**Book Summary: The Way of the Superior Man by David Deida**

This comprehensive guide for men with "masculine sexual essence" and their partners presents a radical philosophy of spiritual growth through sexual polarity. The book argues modern relationships suffer from "depolarization"—the neutralization of masculine/feminine differences in pursuit of equality—and advocates returning to authentic expression of core essences while maintaining mutual respect.

## **Preface & Introduction: The Three Stages of Sexual Identity**

The author identifies three evolutionary stages:
1. **Traditional**: Macho men vs. submissive housewives (manipulation through dominance/dependence)
2. **50/50 Balanced**: Men embrace feminine qualities; women embrace masculine traits (politically correct but sexually neutral)
3. **True Polarity**: Partners maintain core essences—masculine (purpose/direction) and feminine (love/flow)—magnifying differences during intimacy to sustain passion

**Key Concepts**:
- **Sexual Polarity**: The magnetic attraction between masculine and feminine poles, essential for passion
- **Masculine Essence**: Driven by mission, freedom, and purpose; attracted to feminine energy in all forms
- **Feminine Essence**: Driven by love, flow, and relational connection; seeks to be "filled" with love
- Approximately 90% of people have a distinct masculine or feminine essence; only 10% are truly balanced

## **PART ONE: A Man's Way (Chapters 1-15)**

### **1. Stop Hoping for Completion**
Life never ends; the masculine error is postponing fulfillment. Spend at least one hour daily doing what you love NOW. Stop waiting for finances, children, or circumstances to change. If your woman's moods are intolerable, leave; if merely distasteful, practice love rather than fixing her.

### **2. Live With an Open Heart Even If It Hurts**
Never close down during pain. A superior man remains free in feeling and action. Practice opening your chest/belly when hurt instead of contracting. Only with an open body can full intelligence manifest.

### **3. Live As If Your Father Were Dead**
Free yourself from paternal expectations. For three days, do activities you've avoided due to father's influence. True freedom requires shedding familial approval-seeking.

### **4. Know Your Real Edge and Don't Fake It**
Honor your actual capacity, not imaginary limits. Pick one life area (career, relationship) and identify where fear stops you. A fearful man who knows his fear is more trustworthy than one in denial. Lean into fear, don't avoid or aggressively violate it.

### **5. Always Hold To Your Deepest Realization**
Life is empty without connection to eternal, unchanging consciousness. Make life an ongoing process of being your deepest self. Use meditation, books, and teachers to steep in this source. From depth, live the details—money, sex, family—as expressions of freedom, not obligations.

### **6. Never Change Your Mind Just to Please a Woman**
Listen to her, then make YOUR decision. Betraying your deepest knowledge weakens both partners and breeds resentment. Self-trust engenders others' trust, even if you're wrong. A man willing to be wrong and grow is stronger than one who safely avoids decisions.

### **7. Your Purpose Must Come Before Your Relationship**
Admit you'd choose purpose over relationship if forced. A man who prioritizes relationship weakens himself and cheats his woman of an authentic man. Give her 30 minutes of undivided attention, then return to mission. Quality over quantity.

### **8. Lean Just Beyond Your Edge**
Growth is optimized by leaning slightly beyond capacity/fear constantly—not lazing in comfort or pushing too hard. Fear is your friend; it shows your edge. Staying with fear allows transformation. Practice being at the edge in all life aspects.

### **9. Do It for Love**
Penetrate the world and your woman not for gain/pleasure, but to magnify love. Many men settle for partial freedom and incomplete gifting. True ravishment means dissolving boundaries until only love remains. Sex and world-engagement are the same practice: penetrating chaos with love.

### **10. Enjoy Your Friends' Criticism**
A man's capacity to receive masculine criticism measures his trustworthiness. Weekly, discuss fears with men friends who give behavioral experiments. Good friends don't tolerate mediocrity; they offer "stark light of love" to reveal true direction.

### **11. If You Don't Know Your Purpose, Discover It, Now**
Without conscious purpose, a man is lost and weak (even sexually impotent). Align diet, career, everything to your core desire. Your mission is your priority—the source from which you give gifts without seeking fulfillment.

### **12. Be Willing To Change Everything**
Purpose unfolds in layers. Each fulfilled layer becomes empty/boring—discard it cleanly. Signs of completion: sudden disinterest, no regrets, clarity, increased energy, project seeming silly. Wait for next vision; don't fill time with distractions. New mission arises spontaneously.

### **13. Don't Use Your Family As an Excuse**
Compromising purpose for family weakens your core; woman loses trust/polarity. Children need your PRESENCE more than your TIME. A father living his truth teaches by osmosis. Don't let domestic duties neutralize your mission.

### **14. Don't Get Lost in Tasks**
Masculine "do mode" is strength and weakness. Tasks never complete you. Interrupt daily schedule with refreshers: contemplate death, enlightened beings, mystery of existence. Remember you're not a drone but "unbounded mystery of love."

### **15. Stop Hoping for Your Woman to Get Easier**
Women test men's capacity to remain unperturbed. Testing is her pleasure—feeling your Shiva-like strength, integrity, and freedom from needing her validation. The most loving women test most. It's never-ending; embrace it as natural. She wants to feel you cannot be moved off your deep purpose.

## **PART TWO: Dealing With Women (Chapters 16-22)**

### **16. Women Are Not Liars**
The feminine expresses transient feelings, not literal truths. "I hate you" = current feeling-wave, not permanent stance. Don't argue literal content; instead, establish love-flow first. Never base plans on her words unless said in full love-flow.

### **17. Praise Her**
Masculine grows by challenge; feminine grows by praise. Praise specific qualities 5-10x daily—especially those not yet praiseworthy. "You're beautiful when you smile" works better than "You're ugly when you frown." Praise is literal food for feminine radiance.

### **18. Tolerating Her Leads to Resenting Her**
Never just tolerate her moods. Participate actively—tickle, dance, wrestle, penetrate her closure with humor and love. If you resign, you become weak and she builds resentment. Serve her into openness; don't endure her closedness.

### **19. Don't Analyze Your Woman**
Her moods are like weather—90% stem from feeling unloved. Analysis worsens it. Instead, give love immediately: touch, hold, look deeply. Convert emotion to love first; discuss later if needed.

### **20. Don't Suggest She Fix Her Own Emotions**
Asking her to analyze/fix her feelings negates her feminine core (pure energy in motion). She doesn't want to be her own man. Surrender into love is her path, not masculine-style analysis. Let her be the ocean; don't build swimming pools.

### **21. Stay With Her Intensity—To a Point**
When she gets emotionally intense, mediocre men try to calm her or leave. A superior man penetrates her mood with unwavering love and consciousness. Practice staying full through storms. If she refuses love after persistent effort, let her go. Don't avoid; master through love.

### **22. Don't Force the Feminine to Make Decisions**
Giving her total decision-making freedom is masculine abandonment. She wants your direction. Give your perspective clearly while honoring her freedom. Depolarization occurs when both partners become masculine decision-makers.

---

## **PART THREE: Working With Polarity and Energy (Chapters 23-28)**

### **23. Your Attraction to the Feminine Is Inevitable**
Masculine men are attracted to ALL feminine energy forms—women, music, nature, beer. Suppressing this creates shame and weakens your core. Attraction is natural; act on it wisely. See feminine forms as blessings, not just sexual objects. Convert attraction into spiritual offering.

### **24. Choose a Woman Who Is Your Complementary Opposite**
80% of men (masculine essence) need highly feminine women—chaotic, emotional, wild. The "whole package" includes traits that seem irritating (unpredictability, "lying") but are aspects of the same energy that inspires passion. Neutral women create neutral relationships.

### **25. Know What Is Important in Your Woman**
Clarify relationship purpose. If you want passionate consort, don't force her into accountant/buddy roles. Most men neutralize relationships by mixing purposes (business, friendship, parenting). Prioritize sexual/spiritual transmission or accept a utilitarian partnership.

### **26. You Will Often Want More Than One Woman**
Desire for sexual variety is natural in masculine essence. Not a reflection of lack, but of biological/spiritual energy. Self-discipline means higher desires rule lower ones. Prove capacity with one first. Acting on every desire complicates life.

### **27. Young Women Offer Special Energy**
Youth = uncompromised, refreshing feminine energy. Not just sexual—whole-body rejuvenation. Our culture sexualizes this; traditionally it was honored spiritually. Receive energy respectfully without imposing agenda. Circulate desire through body as gift.

### **28. Each Woman Has a "Temperature"**
"Hot" women (fiery, passionate) vs. "Cool" women (soothing, calm). Your needs change based on life circumstances. Don't confuse energy needs with love commitment. Balance through diet, environment, or non-sexual energy exchange—not necessarily new partners.

---

## **PART FOUR: What Women Really Want (Chapters 29-34)**

### **29. Choose a Woman Who Chooses You**
If she doesn't want you as much as you want her, it's over. Reversed polarity (your feminine desire > hers) creates untrustable dynamic. She must feel your mission is priority, not relationship-neediness.

### **30. What She Wants Is Not What She Says**
She tests your capacity to do what's RIGHT, not what she literally asks. When she begs for ejaculation, she wants to feel your strength to NOT ejaculate if that's your truth. Always follow your deepest intuitive wisdom, not her requests.

### **31. Her Complaint Is Content-Free**
Specific complaints (garage, TV, finances) are not the real issue. She's responding to your lack of integrity/clarity. Feeling your failure to live from deepest truth hurts her. Your track record is meaningless—only present moment matters. Restore love/happiness first; specifics later.

### **32. She Doesn't Really Want to Be Number One**
She seems to but actually wants you dedicated to your highest purpose—even at relationship's expense. A man who'd abandon mission for her feels weak and needy. She wants to trust you'd sacrifice relationship for truth, which paradoxically makes you trustworthy.

### **33. Your Excellent Track Record Is Meaningless**
Feminine responds only to present-moment energy, not past behavior. One failure erases a thousand successes. Don't justify mistakes with history; instantly shift energy with humor, love, surprise.

### **34. She Wants to Relax in Your Direction**
She needs to trust you can steer financially, sexually, emotionally, spiritually. Ambiguity forces her into masculine role, diminishing radiance. Provide clarity—she relaxes into feminine. Directionlessness makes her anxious and controlling.

---

## **PART FIVE: Your Dark Side (Chapters 35-38)**

### **35. You Are Always Searching for Freedom**
Masculine ecstasy = release from constraint (orgasm, sports wins, war). This is "petite mort" (little death). Ultimate freedom requires ego-death—surrender of separate self. Fear of real death prevents spiritual liberation. Most men settle for temporary releases.

### **36. Own Your Darkest Desires**
Suppressed ravishment desire becomes violent fantasy. Ravishing = breaking through resistance to open heart in love. Must reclaim full force—dark and light—or it emerges destructively. Let go of control during sex; dissolve into love.

### **37. She Wants the "Killer" in You**
Feminine attracted to man's capacity to face death, kill if necessary (metaphorically). Not actual violence, but fearlessness. Standing on chair for mouse = turnoff. Warrior capacity = turnon. Develop spiritual guts to yield into unknown.

### **38. She Needs Your Consciousness to Match Her Energy**
She cycles through infinite moods (witch, goddess, lover). Whatever energy you can't match, she'll return to. Meet her intensity bodily—not verbally. Contracted chest won't convince; full-bodied presence transforms. She tests your weak links until you pervade all energy with love.

---

## **PART SIX: Feminine Attractiveness (Chapters 39-43)**

### **39. The Feminine Is Abundant**
Feeling starved for feminine energy is self-created resistance. Life IS feminine energy. Practice feeling the present moment as a naked woman—press into it, breathe it, receive it fully. Convert every interaction into energy reception.

### **40. Allow Older Women Their Magic**
Don't demand women stay young. Youth = temporary radiance; age = deep wisdom, psychic power, healing capacity. Each age has unique value. Spiritually mature older women challenge you more, preventing mediocrity.

### **41. Turn Your Lust Into Gifts**
Don't suppress or spill lust. Circulate sexual energy through breath throughout body. Desire for union with feminine mirrors desire for spiritual oneness. Convert attraction from "obsession with form" to "revelation through form." Give what you want to receive.

### **42. Never Allow Desire to Become Suppressed or Depolarized**
Depolarization creates mutual disgust. Familiarity demagnetizes. When you "tolerate" instead of "pervade" your woman, she becomes ugly. It's YOUR doing. Take responsibility—re-invade her with love, even when repulsed. Treat her as goddess/mistress, not buddy. World responds same way.

### **43. Use Her Attractiveness as Slingshot**
Women are epitome of appearance's promise. They attract but cannot absolutely satisfy. Use desire as doorway to oneness: feel THROUGH her into the source. Practice dissolution—giving so fully you forget yourself. Let attraction reveal your own deep nature, not chain you to forms.

---

## **PART SEVEN: Body Practices (Chapters 44-46)**

### **44. Ejaculation Should Be Converted or Consciously Chosen**
Frequent ejaculation creates distrust and depletion. Woman can drain you; so can world. Conditioned from teenage masturbation to release tension. Instead: circulate energy, bypass ejaculation for whole-body/orgasm. Show capacity for consciousness over reflex. Deep penetration dissolves her heart; ejaculation ends it.

### **45. Breathe Down the Front**
Masculine blocks accumulate along front body line (head to perineum). Practice deep inhalation filling belly, solar plexus, chest—exhaling up spine. Opens presence, dissolves self-concern. Use breath to pervade lover's body, opening her knots with loving force.

### **46. Ejaculate Up the Spine**
Recondition nervous system: relax muscles instead of tensing during sex. Feel THROUGH partner, not just self. Practice contracting pelvic floor (anus, perineum, genitals) and pulling up while breathing energy up spine. Converts depletive spurt into rejuvenative brain-orgasm. Heart-open love governs energy flow.

## **PART EIGHT: Men's and Women's Yoga of Intimacy (Chapters 47-51)**

### **47. Take into Account the Primary Asymmetry**
Core difference: For masculine man, intimate relationship is *an* important aspect; for feminine woman, it *is* the central core that colors everything. Mission = masculine priority; love flow = feminine priority. Honor this asymmetry through mutual gifting, not compromise.

### **48. You Are Responsible for Growth in Intimacy**
After personal responsibility comes gift-giving responsibility. Masculine gift: guide her out of moods into love (max 5 minutes). Feminine gift: bring you into body/present. You are responsible for relationship's direction and her depth of love. She is responsible for your embodiment and energy.

### **49. Insist on Practice and Growth**
Don't compromise with bullshit. Softened direction = Mr. Nice Guy. Superior man demands fullest incarnation of love. Slice through excuses with compassion. Insist on practices that serve divine growth, not personal comfort. Use challenges, accountability, consequences.

### **50. Restore Purpose in Solitude and with Men**
Too much togetherness creates neutralization. Women need women's company to reclaim radiance. Men need: 
- **Solitude**: Eliminate comforts, face suffering, discover purpose through austerity
- **Men's Gatherings**: Challenge each other beyond fear, cut through mediocrity, celebrate without lapsing
Arrange this for both partners to prevent stagnation.

### **51. Practice Dissolving**
Ultimate masculine desire: utter release (like orgasm). Practice dissolving in each moment—loving through woman and world without suppression. Trust love's direction. Die in giving your gift until holding onto self is forgotten. This is the final practice: constant dissolution into divine giving.
