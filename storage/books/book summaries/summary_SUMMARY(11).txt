**BURY MY HEART AT WOUNDED KNEE: DETAILED SUMMARY OF PART 1 (Chapters 1-7)**

This opening section establishes the book's central thesis: the systematic destruction of Native American civilization between 1860-1890 through government duplicity, military aggression, and settler greed, all justified by Manifest Destiny. Dee Brown presents this history entirely from the Native perspective, using tribal leaders' own words to expose the betrayal and brutality of American expansion.

### **Introduction & Chapter 1: "Their Manners Are Decorous and Praiseworthy"**

The book opens with a damning indictment of 400 years of European conquest, beginning with Columbus's description of generous Tainos who were subsequently enslaved and exterminated. Brown identifies the pattern repeated across centuries: initial friendly contact, followed by land theft, broken treaties, and genocidal warfare. By 1860, the "permanent Indian frontier" established at the 95th meridian had already collapsed under pressure from miners, settlers, and railroads.

**Key Themes Established:**
- **Manifest Destiny** as a "lofty plane" for land hunger, sanctifying white supremacy and theft
- The treaty system as a deliberate fraud: "In perpetuity meant until we wanted the land we had given them"
- The reduction of Native populations by 50-66% since European contact
- The transition from woodland tribes (Pequot, Narragansett, Cherokee) to Plains nations as the final theater of conquest

**Critical Leaders Introduced:**
- **Little Crow** (Mdewkanton Santee): A 60-year-old chief who tried the white man's road (Christianity, farming) but became radicalized by starvation and trader corruption
- **Red Cloud** (Oglala Teton Sioux): The emerging warrior chief who would lead the most successful Indian war against the U.S.
- **Black Kettle** (Southern Cheyenne): A peaceful chief who trusted American promises and would pay with his life
- **Manuelito** (Navaho): Wealthy stockraiser who resisted relocation

### **Chapter 2: The Long Walk of the Navahos (1860-1868)**

This chapter details the Navaho removal from their Dinétah homeland to Bosque Redondo, a barren reservation in New Mexico.

**Key Events:**
- Manuelito's band, prosperous herders, were attacked at Fort Defiance when their livestock grazed "soldier pastures"
- The 1861 Fort Fauntleroy horse race massacre: Soldiers slashed Manuelito's bridle, then shot Navahos when they protested, killing a child
- General Carleton's brutal 1863-64 "scorched earth" campaign with Kit Carson: "Attack and kill every male Indian over twelve years of age"
- Carson's destruction of 5,000+ peach trees in Canyon de Chelly—an act of cultural devastation the Navahos never forgave
- The 300-mile "Long Walk" winter death marches: 3,000 Navahos forced to march with inadequate food, shelter, or wagons; 10-20% died en route
- Bosque Redondo's alkaline water and crop failures caused mass starvation and disease; investigators called it "a concentration camp"
- The 1868 treaty allowed return, but only after promising "from this day forward all war...shall forever cease"—the first of many such pledges

**Manuelito's Lament:** "They made us many promises, more than I can remember, but they never kept but one; they promised to take our land, and they took it."

### **Chapter 3: Little Crow's War (1862-1863)**

The Santee Sioux uprising in Minnesota, triggered by starvation and trader Andrew Myrick's infamous "let them eat grass" insult.

**Key Events:**
- **Summer 1862**: After two years of treaty payment failures, Santees faced actual starvation. Myrick's insult at the Redwood council became the spark
- **August 18, 1862**: Four hungry young men killed five settlers; Little Crow was taunted as a "coward" when he opposed war, forcing him to lead the fight
- **Battles**: Successful attacks on Lower Agency, New Ulm (partial), and ambush at Birch Coulee; failed sieges of Fort Ridgely
- **Military Response**: "Long Trader" Henry Sibley (who'd stolen $145K from Santee treaty money) led 1,400 soldiers
- **Aftermath**: 2,000 Santees surrendered; 303 men sentenced to death by military court; Lincoln commuted all but 38
- **December 26, 1862**: America's largest mass execution—38 Santees hanged in Mankato. Two were executed by mistake
- **Exile**: Survivors shipped to Crow Creek reservation in Dakota Territory, where a third died the first winter

**Little Crow's Final Words:** "I am ashamed to call myself a Sioux...We are only little herds of buffalo left scattered; the great herds that once covered the prairies are no more."

### **Chapter 4: War Comes to the Cheyennes (1864-1865)**

The systematic betrayal of peaceful Cheyennes culminated in the Sand Creek massacre.

**Key Events:**
- **Treaty of Fort Wise (1861)**: Black Kettle and other "peace chiefs" ceded Colorado lands, but reservation was unsuitable—no game, no water
- **Spring 1864**: Colonel Chivington's Colorado Volunteers operated under "kill Cheyennes whenever and wherever found"
- **Lean Bear's murder**: A chief bearing Lincoln's peace medal was shot down while approaching soldiers with handshake
- **Governor Evans's duplicity**: Issued proclamation for "friendly Indians" to report to Fort Lyon, then sent Chivington to massacre them
- **September 1864**: Wynkoop's peace mission brought Black Kettle, White Antelope, and other chiefs to Denver. Chivington and Evans pretended interest in peace while planning extermination
- **November 28, 1864**: Chivington's 700 troops attacked Black Kettle's sleeping village of 600 (mostly women/children) at Sand Creek
- **Atrocities**: White Antelope and 160+ killed; bodies mutilated (genitals cut off, fetuses ripped from wombs). Chivington's men "waded in gore"
- **Survivors**: Black Kettle escaped but lost his wife; George Bent (half-breed) renounced white heritage and joined warriors
- **Consequences**: Peace chiefs discredited; Dog Soldiers (Roman Nose, Tall Bull) took leadership; tribes united for revenge raids along Platte

**Black Kettle's Plea:** "I want to be friendly and peaceable...Why don't you talk, and go straight, and let all be well?"

### **Chapter 5: Powder River Invasion (1865)**

General Connor's failed three-column invasion of the Powder River country.

**Key Events:**
- **Summer 1865**: Connor launched "Powder River Expedition" to crush Sioux, Cheyenne, and Arapaho resistance
- **Arapaho village destroyed**: 50+ killed at Tongue River; 1,000 ponies captured; entire winter food supply burned
- **Cole & Walker's columns**: Starved, mutinous soldiers slaughtered 900 horses and fled; pursued by Sitting Bull's Hunkpapas
- **Roman Nose's charge**: Demonstrated that massed Indian charges couldn't overcome modern rifles and artillery
- **Result**: Connor abandoned campaign; Indians gained confidence; Connor's forts (Reno, Phil Kearny, C.F. Smith) remained as hated symbols

**Key Insight:** Indians learned they could win through harassment and isolation, but needed modern weapons to match U.S. firepower.

### **Chapter 6: Red Cloud's War (1866-1868)**

The most successful Indian war in American history, led by Oglala chief Red Cloud.

**Key Events:**
- **Fort Laramie Treaty (1866)**: Attempted to validate Bozeman Road through Powder River country; Red Cloud walked out when Carrington's regiment arrived during negotiations
- **Guerrilla warfare**: 3,000 warriors under Red Cloud, Dull Knife, and Roman Nose besieged Fort Phil Kearny, cut wood trains, harassed soldiers
- **December 21, 1866**: **Fetterman Massacre** - 81 soldiers lured into ambush at Peno Creek; no survivors. Indians lost ~200 but achieved complete victory
- **U.S. Response**: Sent Sanborn Commission (1867) to negotiate, but Red Cloud refused to talk until soldiers left
- **1868**: After Wagon Box and Hayfield fights (defended by new breech-loading rifles), government finally conceded. All forts abandoned and burned by Indians in triumph
- **Treaty of 1868**: Red Cloud dictated terms; U.S. agreed to close Bozeman Road and abandon Powder River country. Red Cloud didn't sign until November, after verification of troop withdrawal

**Red Cloud's Victory Speech:** "The Great Father sent his soldiers out here to spill blood. I did not first commence the spilling of blood...If the Great Father stops white men out of my country, peace would last forever."

### **Chapter 7: "The Only Good Indian Is a Dead Indian" (1866-1868)**

The brutal continuation of war on the Southern Plains under Hancock and Sheridan.

**Key Events:**
- **Dog Soldiers' return**: Tall Bull, Roman Nose, and other Cheyenne warriors came back from Powder River to reclaim Kansas hunting grounds
- **Hancock's Campaign (1867)**: 1,400 soldiers marched on Cheyenne camps. Hancock's arrogance ("I have come to kill Indians") and threats of attack
- **Roman Nose's defiance**: Warned Hancock about Sand Creek memories; refused to be intimidated
- **Platte Bridge Fight (1865)**: Red Cloud's alliance demonstrated ability to coordinate large-scale operations
- **Treaty of Little Arkansas (1865)**: Black Kettle and Little Raven forced to cede Colorado claims, but peace lasted only months
- **Railroad expansion**: Union Pacific construction brought new waves of settlers; Indians attacked Iron Horses and supply trains
- **Emerging leaders**: Young warriors like Crazy Horse and Gall developing tactics that would later defeat Custer

**Critical Quote:** Chivington's public declaration, "Nits make lice!"—justifying infant murder—became emblematic of U.S. policy toward Indians.

### **Key Takeaways from Part 1:**

1. **Pattern Recognition**: The U.S. consistently used treaties as instruments of dispossession, making promises to obtain signatures, then immediately violating them through military force, settlement, or legislation.

2. **Dual Strategies**: Indians faced an impossible choice—accommodation (Black Kettle, Little Crow) led to massacre; resistance (Red Cloud, Roman Nose) brought massive retaliation but occasional victories.

3. **Technological Asymmetry**: The repeating rifle and artillery gave the U.S. insurmountable advantages in open battle, forcing Indians toward guerrilla tactics.

4. **Dehumanization**: From Myrick's "eat grass" to Chivington's "nits make lice," official policy explicitly treated Indians as subhuman, justifying genocide.

5. **Failed Leaders**: Peace chiefs were systematically destroyed—Black Kettle survived Sand Creek only to die later at Washita; Little Crow died a hunted fugitive; Manuelito endured the Long Walk. Their trust in U.S. honor proved fatal.

6. **Successful Resistance**: Red Cloud's war proved that coordinated Indian resistance could defeat U.S. strategic objectives, making the Powder River country temporarily unconquerable.

7. **Foundation for Future Conflict**: Every betrayal and massacre in this section (Sand Creek, Long Walk, Fetterman) created a new generation of warriors determined to fight to the death rather than surrender. This sets the stage for the Great Sioux War of 1876-77 that will dominate later sections.

Brown's narrative technique—centering Indian voices, using their own words from council records, and juxtaposing official U.S. rhetoric with on-the-ground realities—creates an unflinching indictment of American expansion as a crime against humanity.
