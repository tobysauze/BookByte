**DETAILED SUMMARY OF "THE SCIENCE OF MIND" BY ERNEST SHURTLEFF HOLMES (1926)**

---

## **OVERVIEW**
This foundational text presents a complete metaphysical system for mental and spiritual healing based on the principle that the universe is fundamentally mental/spiritual, not material. Holmes synthesizes ancient wisdom with modern psychological insights, teaching that through understanding and consciously using Universal Mind (God) and its Laws, individuals can heal disease, overcome poverty, and achieve happiness.

## **PART I: THE EVOLUTION OF MAN'S THOUGHT**

### **Key Themes:**
1. **From Instinct to Self-Consciousness:** Human evolution progressed from "Instinctive Man" (unconscious, automatic functioning) to self-aware individuality. Once man discovered "I AM," he became responsible for his own further development through conscious cooperation with divine law.

2. **Nature's Partnership:** Instinctive Life (God) built the perfect body and then "let man alone" to discover himself. Nature waits on human self-recognition and operates through laws that man can learn and utilize.

3. **The Greatest Discovery:** Man's realization that **thought has creative power**—not the brain, but an unseen "thinker" behind it. The brain is merely an instrument; the real thinker is Mind itself.

4. **The Threefold Nature:** The universe (and man) operates as a Trinity:
   - **Spirit (Father):** Self-Conscious Intelligence, the only volitional power
   - **Soul (Son/Holy Ghost):** The receptive, creative medium/law that executes Spirit's will
   - **Body:** The manifestation/form created by Spirit through Soul

5. **Unity vs. Duality:** All true philosophy teaches Unity—One Power, One Mind, One Life. Belief in duality (good vs. evil as equal forces) is the root of suffering, fear, and limitation.

## **PART II: THE LESSONS**

### **LESSON ONE: THE NATURE OF BEING**

**Core Arguments:**
- **Science of Mind** is built on observable facts, like any science. No one has seen electricity or Mind, but we know they exist by their effects.
- **Universal Mind** is the medium through which all thought operates. It's omnipresent, impersonal, and creative.
- **Mental Law** is automatic and obedient: it receives thought impressions and manifests them without question.
- **Man is threefold**: His conscious mind thinks, his subjective mind receives and creates, and his body manifests the result.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Inductive vs. Deductive Reasoning:** God/Mind reasons only deductively (from whole to part), while man can reason both ways. This explains why subjective mind cannot refuse any suggestion—it must act.
- **Creation is Eternal:** Not making something from nothing, but Spirit continuously passing into form through Law. The universe is alive with constant flow and change within the Changeless.
- **Mental Equivalents:** We can only demonstrate what we can mentally conceive. Our subjective state (sum of all beliefs) determines our experience.

**Examples:**
- Electricity existed before Moses but wasn't utilized until discovered. Similarly, mental laws exist and wait for discovery.
- A seed contains the complete idea of the plant; similarly, thoughts contain complete manifestations.

### **LESSON TWO: THE NATURE OF MAN**

**Core Arguments:**
- Man reënacts the Divine Trinity: Spirit (self-knowing), Soul (creative medium), and Body (manifestation).
- **Individuality means self-choice with power to externalize it.** God created man perfect but free, and cannot compel that freedom—that would negate it. Suffering comes from ignorance, not divine will.
- Man's conscious mind is his "God-consciousness"—the point where Universal Spirit becomes individual.
- **Karmic Law** is mental: what we subjectively believe and think creates our conditions. We are bound by our own freedom.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Sin = Mistake; Punishment = Consequence.** Evil is misused law, not an entity. Stop making mistakes, and suffering ends.
- **Law of Reflection:** Life mirrors our thoughts. "As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he."
- **Prosperity Consciousness:** Money is spiritual supply objectified. We attract what we are mentally equivalent to.

**Examples:**
- The Prodigal Son story illustrates man's journey from ignorance to self-discovery.
- The myth of hiding divinity "in the innermost nature of man"—the last place he'd look.

### **LESSON THREE: MENTAL HEALING**

**Core Arguments:**
- **Disease is mental, not physical.** The body without mind cannot be sick. Disease is an image of thought held in mind until it appears in the body.
- **Mental Treatment:** The practitioner realizes perfection within their own consciousness, and through the Unity of Mind, this realization operates in the patient. Treatment is done *in* the mind of the practitioner, not *to* the patient.
- **No Incurable Disease:** Since Law is infinite, limitation is only in our belief. Every disease has a mental cause, often subconscious (race-suggestion, suppressed emotion, inherited tendencies).

**Healing Methodology:**
1. **Turn entirely from the condition**—never treat disease as reality. See only perfection.
2. **Specific statements:** "This word is for [Name]. [Name] is perfect, whole, and complete. Disease has no power, no law, no place."
3. **Handle root causes:** Fear, anger, resentment, jealousy, inferiority complexes.
4. **Use argumentative or realization methods**—either logically convince yourself or directly perceive the truth.

**Key Examples:**
- Healing tuberculosis by realizing "Perfect lungs now" and denying any power to the appearance.
- Treating stammering by affirming "Perfect speech now."
- Handling constipation by affirming "No restriction, perfect freedom of action."

### **LESSON FOUR: THE CONTROL OF CONDITIONS**

**Core Arguments:**
- **Law of Reflection:** The subjective world perfectly mirrors objective thought. "Life is the mirror of king and slave."
- **Demonstration:** Bringing desires into experience through mental imagery and conviction.
- **No Competition:** Abundance is infinite. One person's prosperity doesn't limit another's.
- **Personal Responsibility:** The only obstacle is our own limited thought. "Water reaches its own level"—so does consciousness.

**Practical Application:**
- **For prosperity:** Visualize clearly, feel the reality, declare "It is done," then release it to Law.
- **For activity:** See your business/store filled with people. The image in mind must be definite.
- **For relationships:** Become what you wish to attract. "If you want a friend, be one."

**Key Examples:**
- Four men treated for employment each receive different salaries based on their mental capacity to receive, not the treatment's limitation.
- A seed contains the complete plant—no need to force its growth, only provide the right conditions.

### **LESSON FIVE: THE PERFECT WHOLE**

**Core Arguments:**
- **Intersphering Trinity:** Spirit, Soul, and Body exist simultaneously at every point. The Big Circle (God) contains the small circle (individual) without separation.
- **God as Infinite Personality:** While Law is impersonal, Spirit is deeply personal and responsive to every individual.
- **Atonement is not vicarious suffering** but man's realization of Unity with Good. Jesus demonstrated this; we must live it.
- **The Christ:** The Universal Idea of Sonship that each person expresses in degree.

**Key Concepts:**
-  **"Act as though I am, and I will be"**  —the key to demonstration.
- **High Invocation:** Consciously planting seeds of desire in Universal Mind.
- **The Still Small Voice:** Intuition is God guiding man without forcing.

**Examples:**
- Jesus' method: Recognition ("I thank Thee"), Unification ("Thou hearest me always"), Command ("Lazarus, come forth").

### **LESSON SIX: PSYCHIC PHENOMENA**

**Core Arguments:**
- Psychic powers (telepathy, clairvoyance, psychometry, telekinesis) are natural mental faculties, not supernatural.
- **Subjective Mind** stores all memories and race-thought; it can be read by those attuned to it.
- **Mental Atmospheres:** People, places, and objects radiate vibrations of accumulated thought.
- **Immortality is now:** We already have eternal consciousness. Death is merely transition, not extinction.

**Key Distinctions:**
- **Mystic vs. Psychic:** Mystics sense Divine Thought (Universal Truth); psychics read human thought (subjective impressions).
- **Normal vs. Abnormal Psychic States:** Healthy use maintains conscious control; trance states are dangerous surrender of individuality.
- **Ghosts/Spirits:** May be mental pictures from the "walls of time," not necessarily discarnate entities.

**Examples:**
- Table-tipping, automatic writing, levitation demonstrate mind-over-matter.
- The "halo" is real—intense spiritual consciousness creates luminous aura.
- Memory of entire race history is stored in Universal Subjectivity.

## **PART III: SPECIAL ARTICLES**

### **Key Themes:**
- **Absoluteness and Relativity:** The Absolute (God) is unconditioned; relativity (creation) is its expression. Both are real and necessary.
- **Problem of Evil:** Evil has no ultimate reality—it's a misuse of power that disappears when no longer believed in or indulged.
- **The Fall:** Symbolizes man's departure from unity consciousness through belief in duality.
- **Atonement:** Not Jesus suffering for sin, but man realizing his Unity with Good. Jesus demonstrated the Path.
- **Personality of God:** Law is impersonal, but Spirit is deeply personal and responsive to every individual.
- **Evolution:** Not God "becoming," but Spirit eternally unfolding its infinite potential.

## **MAIN TAKEAWAYS**

1. **You are already perfect:** Your true nature is Divine. Sickness, poverty, and unhappiness are temporary illusions created by false thinking, not your real state.
2. **Thought is creative energy:** Every thought sets Universal Law in motion. There is no idle thought—each either builds or destroys.
3. **The Law is impersonal:** It works for anyone who understands and uses it correctly, regardless of worthiness. It returns exactly what you impress upon it.
4. **Healing is revelation, not creation:** You don't create health; you reveal the perfection already present by removing false thoughts.
5. **Individuality is sacred:** Never surrender your conscious control to any external or psychic influence. True power comes from within, in partnership with Divine Intelligence.
6. **Unity is the key:** All problems stem from belief in separation (duality). Realizing your oneness with God/Life solves every problem.
7. **Practice makes perfect:** Use daily meditations, mental treatments, and persistent affirmation to recondition your subjective mind. The process is scientific and certain.
8. **Love and Law work together:** Love is the impelling force; Law is the executors. Use both—love the Good, speak the Word, and trust the Law to fulfill it.

This comprehensive system provides both the philosophical foundation and practical tools for transforming every area of life through conscious alignment with Universal Mind and Its perfect Law.
