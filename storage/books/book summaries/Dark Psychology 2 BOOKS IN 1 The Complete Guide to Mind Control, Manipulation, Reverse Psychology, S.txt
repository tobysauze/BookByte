Introduction


I want to thank and congratulate you for downloading this book, "
Dark Psychology and Manipulation

."


The pace of change in the world today is happening at the speed of a microprocessor. Never in human history have we undergone the sorts of revolutionary changes in communication, travel, and business that we have all witnessed in only a few short years.


Despite all the rapid modernization and digitization, people are still people. Though many of those abrupt changes have disputed our familiar routines and customs, we even process information and seek many of the same goals in our personal and professional lives that we always have. And as in the past, we are still suffering from 

some aspects of the population who engage in harmful and destructive behavior.


This propensity for dark psychology lies in each of us. Because the world changes with digital technology's arrival, we must also adapt our responses to those deviant social behaviors.


Dark Psychology and Manipulation - For a Better Life: The Ultimate Guide to Learning the Art of Persuasion, Emotional Influence, NLP Secrets, Hypnosis, Body Language, and Mind Control Techniques provides readers with a summary of what clinical psychologists have learned about deviant personalities and the way they have learned to adapt within the new tech-heavy environment that seems to permeate everything lately.


This book will give readers the essential information they need to resist and protect themselves from the impositions of emotional and social predators. The way to develop a high degree of emotional intelligence will allow them to achieve the modern workplace and get the best out of the self-improvement programs that will help you make the techniques of emotional predators work for you, not against you.









What Is Dark Psychology?


Dark psychology may raise thoughts of intrigue and even romance. Films and TV productions like Dexter, GoodFellas, CSI, and Criminal Minds have popularized notions of serial killers and "tough but fair" business moguls who hold the town in a tight grip of brutality that is necessary for the greater prosperity and security of everyone.


The truth is, dark psychology is more than just a term in popular culture that describes the alluring, exciting, and adventurous lifestyles of rock stars, international financiers, and crime experts. Popular culture has developed a whole vocabulary to explain the people in our lives who could also be displaying alarmingly high levels of predatory behavior. Entire genres of sitcoms and films depict the comic adventures of otherwise happy and well-adjusted children trapped in toxic relationships.


We have learned to accept to an uncomfortable degree the increasingly common presence of predatory and abusive personality types in our daily lives. So, we frequently overlook or could also be unaware that dark psychology has its roots in severe psychotherapy and has been a scientific inquiry topic for hundreds of years. This chapter will explore many essential terminologies and historical and practical contexts in which this aspect of human relationships remains relevant.


Essential Terms in Dark Psychology


Some essential terms will help readers understand dark psychology's language, including Dark Continuum, Dark Factor, Dark Singularity.


_
      


Dark Continuum

: Imagine the Dark Continuum as a line used to gauge the character and severity of behavior-

based in dark psychology. Mild and purposive acts fall to the left of the continuum, while severe and purposeless actions fall to the right.


For example, if we use the Dark Continuum to measure the kinds of conduct that exhibit dark psychology traits, then psychological and emotional violations would tend to look on the left side of the continuum. At the same time, acts of physical violence would look on the right side of the continuum.


Of course, a particularly severe emotional or psychological violation committed for purely sadistic purposes may appear further to the right on the continuum than a less severe act of physical violence committed for a rational sense.


_
      


Dark Factor

. The Dark Factor is a term used to describe the latent, inherent capacity of every individual to act with malevolence. This term expresses a theoretical concept to elucidate the human propensity to develop personality traits that cause the likelihood of somebody engaging in acts of willful violence, destruction, or harm to others.


Many influences will exacerbate or lessen the prospect that the latent capacity for abuse will be activated. However, people possess a Dark Factor in their psychological makeup.


_
      


Dark Singularity

. This term is additionally used to describe a theoretical concept. It borrows from the language of physics, which represents a singularity as the absolute center of a universe. The singularity in the middle of a black hole contains energy and gravity that is so dense and powerful that, as objects approach it, they became ensnared in its gravitational pull to the point that they cannot escape. Even light can become trapped in the 

singularity of a black hole.


Similarly, the Dark Singularity is a concept used to describe the degenerative process that begins by committing acts anywhere on the Dark Continuum. As a predator's actions increase toward the right end of the Dark Continuum, their psychology becomes increasingly drawn toward further engagement. At some point, they cannot escape the pull of the psychological impulses represented by the right end of the Dark Continuum, and it becomes impossible for them ever to recover to a rational state of mind.


Six Tenets That Define The Nature and Function of Dark Psychology


To gain a far better understanding of dark psychology, Dr. Nuccitelli has compiled the following six tenets that outline the nature and functions of dark psychology:






All people possess the capacity for dark psychology. Dark psychology is not a genetic disease or flaw but a universal aspect of the human condition.






Dark psychology studies the innate human potential for developing predatory behavior that does not serve any practical purpose. Thus, if 99.99% of human behavior is meant to achieve a practical goal, dark psychology represents that .01% capacity in human psychology to interact with an end-goal of causing pain, harm, and damage.






Dark psychology seeks to fill gaps in explaining destructive and harmful human behavior and takes the position that dark psychological behavior traits can manifest themselves anywhere on a continuum of predatory 

behavior, from mild deviance to extreme violence.






The Dark Continuum is not defined exclusively by the end act of deviance or violence, but by the person's practical, psychological motivations. For instance, Jeffrey Dahmer and Ted Bundy were both serial killers. Yet, Dahmer was motivated by the need for companionship and love, however, distorted and delusional, while Bundy was motivated by nothing more than a sadistic desire to inflict pain. Thus, Bundy is further along the dark psychology continuum than Dahmer, even though both were serial killers.






Dark psychology assumes that everyone has the innate capacity for violence. While animals share this capacity, they use violence to serve the need of the predator-prey relationship in the universe. Because people have evolved beyond that state yet still retain the innate ability for violence, this capacity is distorted in human psychology and may be used to act in violence without a practical purpose.






By understanding dark psychology, human society will be more capable of recognizing, diagnosing, and treating those that exhibit these tendencies and helping them understand that such trends need to be channeled in a more productive direction. The more human society masters this aspect of its psychology, the more it will evolve beyond this era of psychological distortion.













Types of Dark Psychology Personalities


Dark psychology is not a single, universally applicable diagnosis that can be applied across all cases of deviant personalities. There are many ways in which dark psychology may manifest in someone's psychological and behavioral makeup. There is no absolute division of one eccentric personality type from another. Many deviant personalities with prominent dark psychology features may display more than one manifestation of dark psychology.


This chapter will explore three types of dark psychology personalities. It is essential to recollect that although the web has spawned an enormous growth in problems resulting from dark psychology, these traits are a part of human culture since ancient times. One of the dark psychology profiles we will explore in this chapter, Machiavellianism, takes its name from a medieval politician. Another narcissism takes its name from an ancient mythological character. Together, the three dark psychology profiles discussed in this chapter—psychopathy, Machiavellianism, and selfishness—make up what is referred to as "the Dark Triad."


Psychopathy


Psychopathy is defined as a mental disturbance with several identifying characteristics. These characteristics include antisocial behavior, amorality, an inability to develop empathy or develop meaningful personal relationships, extreme egocentricity, and recidivism, with repeated violations resulting from an evident failure to learn from earlier results transgressions. In turn, antisocial behavior is defined as behavior based upon a goal of violating formal and/or informal rules of social conduct through criminal activity or 

through acts of personal, private protest, or opposition, all of which is directed against other individuals or society in general.


Egocentricity behavior is when the offending person sees himself or herself as the central focus of the universe or at least all dominant social and political activity. Empathy is the ability to understand events, thoughts, emotions, and beliefs from others' perspectives. It is taken into account one of the essential psychological components for establishing successful, ongoing relationships.


Amorality is entirely different from immorality. An immoral act is an act that violates established moral codes. A corrupt individual is often confronted with his or her actions with the expectation that he or she will recognize that his or her actions are offensive from a moral, if not a legal standpoint. Amorality, on the other hand, represents psychology that does not recognize that any moral codes exist, or if they do, that they need no value in determining whether or not to act in one way or the other.


Thus, someone displaying psychopathy may commit horrendous acts that cause tremendous psychological and physical trauma and not even understand that what he or she has done is wrong. Worse still, those that display signs of psychopathy usually worsen over time because they cannot connect the issues in their lives and the lives of these in the world around them and their own harmful and destructive actions.


Machiavellianism


Strictly defined, Machiavellianism is Machiavelli's political philosophy, who lived from 1469 until 1527 in Italy. In contemporary society, Machiavellianism is a term used to describe the popular understanding of individuals who are perceived as 

displaying very high political or professional ambitions. In psychology, however, the Machiavellianism scale is used to measure the degree to which individuals with deviant personalities display manipulative behavior.


Machiavelli wrote The Prince, a political treatise in which he stated that sincerity, honesty, and other virtues were indeed admirable qualities. In politics, the capacity to interact in deceit, treachery, and different criminal behavior types was acceptable if there have been no other means of achieving political aims to guard one's interests.


Popular misconceptions reduce this complete philosophy to the view that "the end justifies the means." Machiavelli insisted that the more critical a part of this equation was, ensuring must first be justified the end itself. Furthermore, it is better to achieve such ends using means devoid of treachery whenever possible because there is less risk to the actor's interests.


Thus, seeking the most effective means of achieving a political end might not necessarily cause the most treacherous. Additionally, not all political ends are justified as worth pursuing must be pursued. In many cases, the mere threat that a particular course of action could also be pursued could even be enough to achieve that end. In some cases, the treachery could also be as mild as making a reputable threat to take action that is not even intended.


In contemporary society, many of us overlook the fact that Machiavellianism is a component of the "Dark Triad" of dark psychology and tacitly approve of the deviant behavior of political and business leaders who can amass world power or wealth. However, as a psychological disorder, Machiavellianism is entirely different from a selected path to political power.


The person displaying Machiavellian personality traits does not consider whether their actions are the most effective means of achieving their goals. Some alternatives do not involve deceit or treachery or whether their stories' final results are worth achieving. The Machiavellian personality is not evidence of a strategic or calculating mind trying to achieve a worthwhile objective in a contentious environment. Instead, it is always on, whether things call for a cold, calculating, and manipulative approach or not.


For example, we had all called in sick to work when we just wanted a day off. But for most people, such conduct isn't how we usually behave, and after such acts of dishonesty, many people feel guilty. Those that display a high degree of Machiavellianism would not just lie when they need a day off; they see lying and dishonesty as the only way to conduct themselves in all situations, no matter whether doing so leads to any benefit.


What's more, due to the degree of social acceptance and tacit approval granted to Machiavellian personalities who successfully attain political power and their presence in society does not receive the type of negative attention accorded to the other two members of the Dark Triad—psychopathy and narcissism.


Narcissism


The term "narcissism" originates from an Ancient Greek myth about Narcissus, a young man who saw his reflection in a pool of water and fell in love with the image of himself. In psychotherapy, narcissism as an illness was introduced by Freud and has continually been included in official diagnostic manuals as an outline of a specific type of psychiatric personality disorder.


In psychology, narcissism is defined as a condition characterized by 

an exaggerated sense of importance, an excessive need for attention, a scarcity of empathy, and, as a result, dysfunctional relationships. Commonly, narcissists may outwardly display an unusually high level of confidence, but this facade usually hides a fragile ego and a high degree of sensitivity to criticism. There is often a large gulf between a narcissist's highly favorable view of himself or herself, the resulting expectation that others should extend to him or her favors and special treatment, and the disappointment when the results are quite negative or otherwise different. These problems can affect all areas of the narcissist's life, including personal relationships, professional relationships, and financial matters.


As a part of the Dark Triad, those that exhibit traits resulting from personality Disorder (NPD) may engage in relationships characterized by a scarcity of empathy. For instance, a narcissist may demand constant comments, attention, and admiration from his or her partner but will often appear unable or unwilling to reciprocate by displaying concern or responding to his or her partner's concerns, thoughts, and feelings.


Narcissists also display entitlement and expect excessive reward and recognition, but usually without ever having accomplished or achieved anything that might justify such feelings. There is also a tendency toward excessive criticism of these around them. This fact is combined with heightened sensitivity when even the slightest amount of criticism is directed at them.


Thus, while narcissism in popular culture is usually used as a pejorative term and an insult aimed toward people like actors, models, and other celebrities who display high degrees of self-love and satisfaction, NPD is a psychological term that is quite distinct from merely having high self-esteem. The key to understanding this aspect of dark psychology is that the narcissist's image of himself or 

herself is usually completely idealized, grandiose, and inflated and cannot be justified with any real, meaningful accomplishments or capacities make such claims believable. As a result of this discord between expectation and reality, the demanding, manipulative, inconsiderate, self-centered, and arrogant behavior of the narcissist can cause problems not just for himself or herself but also for all of the people in his or her life.









Recognizing Mind Control Techniques


A mind controller approaches the victim with the intent of cloning themselves, making the other person think like them. This fact is often a complicated thing to do, so, to achieve it, one has to possess an inflated ego, lack doubts about themselves, and have a high sense of entitlement. People are vulnerable to manipulation, and what matters is how much effect the mind control will have on us.


Psychologists studying mind control have acknowledged that the whole process seems to stick to a standard structure. This conclusion was made after a study was conducted on multiple marketing and networking companies that used mind control to persuade clients to get their products. One of the remarkable similarities is that each new member joining the businesses underwent pre-planned training to recruit more people and convince potential customers to buy their products. The training sessions are meant to make the workers think, just like the company wants, and use a mind twist to convince people.


Let us now check out the mind control process in detail.


Understanding the Target


Before anything else, the manipulator will seek to develop a bond or connection to their potential victim. Good intent, or friendship, will be the first step because it makes the victim lower all their social and psychological defenses. Once the controller gains the target's trust, they now start getting them ready to plan the most effective method to invade them. The reading aims to tell whether their victim is vulnerable to their manipulation. Just like any project manager, they do not like dalliance on a subject they think might outsmart 

them and cause failure.


Multiple clues are used to scan the victim. They include vocal style, body language, social status, gender, emotional stability, etc. A person's traits are often used to decode the strength of their defenses. At this point, the manipulator is going to be asking them questions like, "Are you introvert or extrovert?” "Are you weakly?” "Are you emotional?” "Are you self-confident?" Humans provide a lot of data about themselves when interacting with one another, and this is often something that the controller knows only too well. From these signs, they will readily tell if the person is cooperating. They are going to check out body posture and immediately analyze the victim. Excess blinking might insinuate that an individual is lying. Arms folded across the chest might show a lack of interest or insecurity. Taking large strides while walking might portray fear. As you can see, the body releases such a lot of data at any given time it is essential to remember the signs that you are giving out (this will be covered in detail later in this book).


When the attacker has collected enough data from the target, they now understand their interests, strengths, weaknesses, routines, and so on. Using this information, they will choose an entry point that will allow for easy and accurate manipulation. They also decide whether the target is worth the effort. If they see one as an optimistic target, they move to the next step in the mind control process- unfreezing factual beliefs and values.


Unfreezing Solid Beliefs and Values


Everyone has some beliefs and values engraved deep within. Most of them are the principles that were instilled in us since childhood, et al. are acquired from experiences are we get older. We rarely abandon them but revise them as we proceed. Most of the structure 

our identities, so we do not like them being interfered with. If these principles are threatened, contradicted, or questioned at any point in time, our natural reaction is to defend them through all means possible. However, if a good-enough reason is given to us, we voluntarily question them ourselves; we undergo a process referred to as "unfreezing."


Many reasons can lead us to unfreeze: a breakup, the death of a loved one, religious interference, getting evicted from our homes, to say but a few. These situations force us to seek answers to complex cases, which goes as deep as questioning our sole beliefs and values. Take this, for example:


When I was an adolescent, we had some family friends who were solid Christians. It so happened that my best friend, who was my exact age, came from this family. His name was Sam. Sam used to tell me about the Bible and its teachings, trying to convince me to accept salvation and live according to its instructions. I remember asking him why he was so insistent on this issue, and he would respond that all problems were solvable with salvation and that life was much easier and happier. Fast-forward about fifteen years, Sam's mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. They tried all kinds of treatment available at the time, but cancer would grow back. One day, while talking to him about the issue, he looked at me with a pale face and said, "I think what they say about Christianity isn't real!" Unsure about what he had just said, I asked him why he thought so. He responded that they had met many spiritual leaders for prayers, but his mother's cancer was only getting worse. What's worse, she wouldn't live for more than a year.


Sad as Sam's story is, it makes us realize that some situations in life might force us to question the vital principles that we grew up with. In this case, my best friend had come to doubt the same religion that 

he once felt had automatic solutions to all or any of life's problems. In the exact same manner, a manipulator will dig deep into their victim's life to know their vulnerabilities and exploit them fully. These people will say anything they think their targets would like to hear. Once the victim swallows the manipulator's comfort, there is a shift in power dynamics, and the target is now ready for the manipulation.


Reprogramming the Mind


The mind control process seeks to separate the target from their initial beliefs and start reprogramming their mind. The reprogramming is supposed to put the manipulator's beliefs and values into the victim's mind. Aside from distancing the initial principles, the controller also tries their best to make them look wrong or bad or explain past mishaps in the victim's life. If the victim absorbs this reprogramming, their defense is lowered to zero, and they now become a robot that is ready to accept any operating system that is offered.


In the reprogramming phase, the attacker will attempt to make sure the victim has minimal contact with the outside world. They make everyone else seem insignificant to the victim because this raises their opportunity to deposit their malicious principles into them. This behavior is typical in cults, mostly crafted to sway their followers from mainstream human life. Some cults go as far as controlling their followers' food intake as a way of weakening them. The psychology behind this concept is that a weak person will always turn to the person they feel has the power to guard them or alleviate their suffering. The same happens in relationships, where one partner plays the controlling role, and the victimized one has no choice but to stick to the other. You might wonder why some people 

put up with violent partners, but so far, from reading this book, you must already understand that the matter is more profound than it appears. If you control a person's mind, you can control their lives.


Once the victim has been re-programmed, the manipulator moves into the ultimate phase of the mind control process called "freezing."


Freezing the New Beliefs and Values


Do you remember the "unfreezing" process we discussed earlier? Once the victim has been fed with contrasting principles by the offender, the offender applies tactics aimed toward cementing the new beliefs into their brains. This fact often is what psychologists call "freezing." The freezing bit is significant because the controller is conscious of the person's new beliefs, which may clash with their initial ones. They have to force the victim to settle on their malicious principles over their old ones. To do this, they could apply any of the following methods.


One of the methods is using the reward/punishment approach. When the victim acts according to the manipulator's demands, they are rewarded. Hopefully, you see the similarity between the freezing process and dog training. The dog is given treats when it follows the trainer's instructions. The trainer aims at solidifying the new skill in the dog by rewarding it. In the future, if the dog is instructed to do the same thing, it will not hesitate since it has been made to think that obeying the command is good and attracts a reward. The same applies to mind control; when the victim follows, they are made to feel that what they did was right and deserves a reward.


Punishments are the second most-applied approach in the freezing process. If the victim deviates from the controller's commands, they are punished. If we return to a cult scenario, they typically have 

defined punishments for violations of terms. In the Holocaust, for example, any Germans who did not hail Hitler were punished through imprisonment or death. In the same way, any German who was suspected of protecting the Jews was shot. Hitler understood that by punishing anyone who went against his rules, he would force every German to help him attain his objective of ethnic cleansing. The psychological trick used in these situations is that the victim is formed to see punishment as justice being served for breaking the rules.


Mind controllers' final method to solidify their manipulation is to transform their victims into their agents. Better put, when the controller feels that the victim's pseudo personality has materialized, they use them to distribute their worldviews. At the beginning of this book, we said that the mind controller plans to make a clone of themselves in the other person. Therefore, once the controlling process is complete, the victim starts living just like the controller without realizing it. Depending on the manipulation's character, the victim may also be used to recruit more victims into the oppressor's way of thinking and living. This fact is often very true in selling and networking, which we shall discuss under the subject of deception. From this explanation, we will readily tell why a wife will probably be violent towards the children if the husband is violent. The children also are likely to be violent towards one another or their friends. The method of mind control is slow, but it may result in devastating effects once it solidifies.









The Tactics of Reverse Psychology


When you consider persuasion, what is it that comes to mind? A few people may consider developing messages that ask watchers to get a specific item. In contrast, others might think of a political applicant trying to persuasion voters to pick their names in the voting booth. Persuasion is a ground-breaking power in lifestyle and impacts society and an entirety. Political issues, right choices, broad communications, news, and advertising are suffering from the intensity of persuasion and impact us. In some circumstances, we wish to accept that we are indifferent to influence. That we have an inherent capacity to see through the plan for selling something, understand the reality in a situation, and reach resolutions entirely. This fact might be valid in certain conditions, yet persuasion isn't only a pushy sales rep trying to sell you a vehicle or a TV ad luring you to get the best in the class item. Persuasion is often reserved, and the way we react to such impacts can depend on a spread of components.


When we consider persuasion, negative models are frequently the first to come to mind, yet influence can likewise be used positively. Public help campaigns that urge individuals to reuse or stop smoking are extraordinary examples of persuasion used to improve individuals' lives.


What Is Persuasion?


So what precisely is persuasion? In the Dynamics of Persuasion, Perloff characterizes influence is often described as "...a typical procedure in which communicators plan to persuade others to change their mentalities or practices concerning a problem through 

the transmission of a message in an environment of free choice."


The critical components of this meaning of persuasion are that:


_
       

Persuasion is representative, using words, pictures, sounds, and so forth


_
       

It includes a purposeful effort to impact others.


_
       

Self-persuasion is significant. Individuals are not forced; they are instead allowed to pick.


_
      

 Strategies for transmitting convincing messages can happen in all kinds of ways, including speaking person-to-person and nonverbally using TV, radio, Internet, or up close and personal correspondence.


Dark Persuasion


Dark persuasion lacks any motive. It is different from a positive influence. This fact is often characterized as the opposite of positive belief as hurting people without cause. Sometimes dark persuader thinks that he is wise and he should try such an act. The motivations of their actions depend on personality type. If they are type B, they will be destructive. Dark persuasion has lethal outcomes. The person will take hold of the other individual and influence them to commit a crime.


And if someone goes against them, they will become evil and may victimize the individual. In many cases, victims lose their lives.


Dark Persuasion Tactics


How do persuaders fulfill their wishes? That depends on the tactic of persuasion. The long con is one of them. In this type, the persuader takes time to gain the trust of the victim. They are going to be friends first. After knowing that the victim trusts them, they begin to target 

their evil persuasion at them. This way results in making the wrong choices by which the persuader alone is getting the benefit.









Secrets of Persuasion


The previous chapters have described some of the worst-case scenarios of how dark psychology and the people that exhibit its most negative and antisocial characteristics may enter our lives and cause considerable harm. Such examples may range from the acute horror of serial killers, stalkers, and other deadly, predatory criminals to comparatively less harmful, more common, but still dangerous personality types who may exert emotional manipulation to get what they need from you.


All of those examples are always present in the world around us, some more common and frequent, others less so. All of them can cause trauma and damage to our lives, starting from simple, mild annoyance, financial harm or job losses, serious physical injury, and loss of life. These examples all share something in common—they are generally examples of behavior that represent, at the very least, violations of established codes of ethical and social conduct, and at the very worst, violations of laws, from petty misdemeanor violations to felonious civil and criminal offenses.


But not all dark psychology manifestations occur in the shadows, in dark alleys, in bad relationships that nobody likes to speak about, or otherwise out of plain sight. Much of the human capacity for dark psychology has been legitimized by non-profit organizations, educational institutes, medical facilities, private corporations, and even government agencies to enable a good range of programs based on psychological manipulation.


That being said, not all efforts to change people's behavior can or should be considered harmful. For instance, at the most harmless level, so-called social influence could also be as benign and even 

desirable because of the way parents teach their children from a young age or how children learn from their teachers at college. Similarly, you may have friends or relations who had offered you friendly advice at a point in your life when you faced a crucial decision or were close to doing something that, in hindsight, could have been an enormous mistake. In these cases, social influence in the form of someone telling you that you should or should not do something is essential to success.


Of course, there are more large-scale social influence campaigns. We are surrounded by advertising campaigns from multi-billion-dollar corporations, each of which wants us to shop for this product. And a large part of the many government agencies' efforts is directed at shaping popular opinion, including changing behavior. In some cases, like convincing people not to drink and drive, to wear their seat belts, or to assist fight forest fires, require huge educational efforts and long-term PR campaigns with repeated messaging to convince people by tapping into both their conscious and subconscious awareness that changing their behavior is in their best interest.


This chapter will discuss three major areas in which well-established and officially recognized organizations use the human capacity for dark psychology in various behavior therapy programs. These include neuro-linguistic programming (NLP), hypnosis, and brainwashing.


Neuro-Linguistic Programming And Non-Verbal Communication


In the 1970s, a new social and movement was established. The virtues of self-improvement and the development of one's full 

human potential were cited as a kind of Holy Grail of higher education. These movements were related to the so-called New Age Spirituality, which challenged traditional beliefs of established Western religious and social conventions.


For example, success in one's personal and business life has typically been considered the result of external recognition of one's efforts. Whether God rewards someone's virtuous conduct or whether society's institutions recognize the worth of someone's professional contributions. The key to success in personal and business life have generally followed from people's ability to conduct themselves according to the established standards and traditions of the larger societies and belief systems in which they live.


New Age Spirituality and the Human Potential Movement attempted to determine an alternate route to success. These new schools of thought used scientific advances in linguistics, politics, technology, sociology, psychology, and medicine to argue that people do not need to depend upon external recognition for fulfillment in any area of their lives. Instead, the overall theory was that each one of us is born with an innate ability to achieve any area of life, which the key to unlocking success lies in an individual's ability to harness the facility of positive psychology, thereby empowering them to achieve success at anything just by perfecting their own unique human psychological and intellectual characteristics.


The school of NLP emerged at this point. The Esalen Center in Northern California was a famous liberal think factory through which the founders of NLP generated many thousands of dollars in book sales and therapy and training workshops. The NLP Foundation has produced several books, which sold many thousands of copies. Although it eventually became notorious for its pseudo-scientific methods and theories based on little, if any, actual scientific proof or 

evidence, self-help has become a multi-billion-dollar global industry. And NLP and the many self-improvement businesses and training programs it inspired are still considered a part of the professional and political landscape.


What Is NLP?


Neuro-linguistic programming is a system of education and training based on understanding developmental, behavioral, and cognitive psychology. Knowledge and practice in NLP focus on three aspects of human psychology: the neurological system, which regulates the physical functioning of the human body; language function, which determines how we interact with other people; and "programming," a term used to describe the beliefs, knowledge, and experiences we accumulate over time that together inform our worldview and determine how we behave.


NLP was initially founded in the 1970s by John Grinder and Richard Bandler. The theories behind their work are based on both the scientific study of linguistics, sociology and political science, as New Age mysticism and the self-improvement movement began in the 1970s. Specifically, their claim that the "map isn't the territory," describing the disconnection between our subjective perception of the planet and reality itself, is taken directly from the work of Korzybski, who founded the varsity of general semantics in 1933.


They also reference Gregory Bateson's work detailing the conflict between flaws in societal and governmental systems and how they will cause problems in human communication and government. Finally, the work of Noam Chomsky, whose theories of transformational and universal grammar linked the important influence language function has in areas as seemingly unrelated as world government and politics. This is one of the first theories used 

to support claims that NLP therapy can transform its followers' lives.


NLP is additionally influenced by many non-scientific movements, including the paranormal writings of Carlos Castenada. Many sociologists have categorized NLP as a pseudo-science and a quasi-religion that belongs to the massive sphere of the New Age and/or Potential Human movements. Some have criticized NLP as a form of folk magic that borrows the language and theories of science and medicine to validate entirely non-scientific practices.


Carlos Castaneda wrote a series of novels in the 1970s portraying shamanism among the indigenous tribes of North America. Many of the NLP modeling techniques borrow directly from Castaneda's novels, including "double induction" and "stopping the world." NLP behavior therapy techniques based on modeling and NLP language coaching use mimetics, almost like the many New Age syncretic religions' rituals.


There is a fundamental philosophical assumption underlying all of the human potential and self-improvement programs that originated when NLP was developed. Objectivism is a philosophy based on the understanding that reality is a fundamental, physical fact—the material world that surrounds is an objective reality. We can come to a version of this reality through our senses. More importantly, objectivism insists that reality is the same for everybody because it is objective. Though individual perceptions may differ, the target reality doesn't.


The philosophies upon which NLP is predicated take a radically different approach and should be considered subjectivism. The essential theory is that everyone is incapable of knowing reality because we all perceive the world subjectively, filtered by what we have learned from previous experiences and cultural and traditional 

learning. Additionally, the part of the world we live in is governed by laws and customs we have come to understand as "true." But these laws and customs differ from one geographical location to another and from one demographic group to another. The world is restricted for each of us because we have only perceived it from a limited and subjective perspective.


According to the founders of NLP, your thoughts, feelings, and beliefs aren't things that really exist; they are things that you have learned to do. Because we have spent numerous years of our lives knowing the way to do this stuff from the people around us, our neurological systems, at some point, accept them as reality. We stop questioning whether other facts or perspectives exist, or, using NLP's language, whether there are other facts and perspectives that might help us do other things. In NLP's language, this is often referred to as an indoor "map of the world" that we learn through sensory experience.


We learn to speak using both verbal and non-verbal language. The words we use, the metaphors we are most comfortable with, the commonest analogies in our speech, our vocabulary, and our level of discipline in using correct grammar or pronunciation. Also, the quantity of slang we use, whether our language is casual or formal, the ideas we talk about, the accent we are presumably to use when speaking. So all of those linguistic abilities follow directly from our map of the world. Although this dual form of communication is too complicated and powerful, our ability to speak is restricted by this subjective reality experience. Together, these two elements, our neurological maps, which successively to form our patterns of linguistic expression, represent our "programming," hence, neuro-linguistic programming.


Verbal and Non-Verbal Communication


When most of us consider language, we think of English or Spanish or Chinese or French or whatever other languages we may be fluent in. For many of us, language is just what we use to speak ideas—whether basic facts about objects and directions, more complicated information involving technical, legal, or medical terminology, or highly developed figurative language to express abstract concepts and ideas. Language has rules. We either follow the standardized rules of grammar and usage, speak a colloquial or regional dialog that uses altered language forms, or adapt language use and invent new ways and uses to suit whatever communication needs we may have. But because our perceptions are limited, our linguistic abilities also are limited. As a result, our programming limits our ability to achieve goals in our personal and professional lives.


Another aspect of language is non-verbal communication. Words and sentences themselves only comprise a part of the whole process of sending messages and communicating. According to Gregory Bateson, one of the language theorists that influenced NLP's event, 8% of data we communicate results from the words we use; the other 92% uses non-verbal cues.


If words are the digital component of communication, non-verbal cues are the analog counterpart. These analog aspects of communication include voice tone, tempo, and volume. Other non-verbal cues may consist of facial expressions, gestures, posture, and eye contact.


Non-verbal communication uses "meta-messages" that provide detailed "editorial" information about the context or motivation for the speaker's words and help the listener determine how to interpret the message. For instance, if someone in a meeting spilled coffee on 

his computer, and it stopped working, he might say, "That’s just great!” If he uses a sarcastic tone of voice, he will communicate the other message concerning the words they convey. Or if an educator in a classroom says, “I want you to concentrate, now,” while pointing at a whiteboard, the message is going to be entirely different than if the same teacher says, “I want you to concentrate now,” while pointing at his ears.


Although only 8% of communication is verbal, 92% of non-verbal cues usually occur out of the speaker's notice. As a result, NLP training sessions spend a lot of your time helping people adapt their non-verbal behavior patterns. The idea is that they may not be getting what they want because they are communicating the wrong message. By sharing a special message, those around them will respond differently also.


According to NLP theories, language serves a much more complex function than merely allowing us to speak facts or maybe more elevated and abstract concepts. NLP theory holds that linguistic development's human capacity is vital because our “body states” are revealed in our language and non-verbal communication. Language is that the tool we use to gain access to the inner workings of the mind,” not just a way of communicating with people. Thus, NLP promises that using “language patterns [can] teach us the way to access unconscious information that might remain vague and unknowable otherwise.”


How Does NLP Work?


NLP's basically promise is that people experiencing difficulties in their lives are being held back because their internal “maps” tell them they are either incapable or not allowed to interact in whatever kind of activity they may have set as a goal for themselves.


In an NLP training session, an experienced NLP practitioner works with the client by eliciting both verbal and non-verbal language to detect the biases, beliefs, and limitations inherent in the person’s map. The NLP practitioner then uses specific techniques to help the client change certain behavior patterns and ideas not to feel that particular behavior or associations are off the map and out of their territory.


A typical NLP session is predicated on “modeling,” in which a licensed NLP trainer coaches the subject who wishes to use NLP to transform their behavior. NLP has become a widely used and varied program of professional and personal development; there is no single, certified, or regulated method of practicing NLP's behavior therapy techniques. Some of the methods most ordinarily used in NLP sessions include:


_
      

 Anchoring: A sensory experience, or a location on the map, is used as a start line to trigger emotional states resulting in change. For instance, if the NLP practitioner finds that a client has difficulty finding motivation at work but not at home, finding the sensory experience that triggers motivation at home is often used as the anchor to supply the client with how to access the motivational drive at work.


_
      

 Rapport: After eliciting various language cues to assess the client's internal subjective map, the NLP practitioner can match physical behavior, non-verbal expression, and language cues to make a bond of empathy.


_
      

 Swish pattern: Once specific patterns of behavior are identified, once the NLP practitioner places the familiar routes the client takes through his or her map, the swish pattern's goal is to change the design of behavior to make 

more desirable outcomes.


_
      

 Visual-kinesthetic dissociation (VKD): If an NLP client is experiencing negative thoughts and feelings due to past events, this system is used to isolate the subjective sensory experience and separate it from memory.


A typical session involves several stages, beginning with establishing rapport between the client and the trainer. During this stage, the trainer elicits information from the client using specifically designed language and non-verbal communication techniques. Next, the trainer uses “meta-model” inquiries to gather information about the client’s current state of affairs, listening to the words the client uses to respond and interpreting non-verbal cues according to NLP-based interpretation of their significance.


The client is encouraged to “visualize” his or her ideal state of success, and the trainer hopes that by changing his or her mental focus, the client’s responses, both verbal and non-verbal, will reveal the secrets are holding them back. The trainer also begins to use “pacing” by leading the client toward change using specifically designed vocabulary and non-verbal cues to retrain the client and help them learn to use different verbal and non-verbal communication methods.


NLP also encourages the use of self-reflection. The client is coached to start envisioning his or her desired future state and how those changes may affect his or her current personal and business life. Next, the trainer helps the client change their internal beliefs about the world, i.e., allows them to reprogram their worldview. In the final change, the client begins rehearsing their new role in the world to know how they will change when all of the changes are finally complete.


According to NLP, these remote sessions end in behavior therapy, 

which will, of itself, inevitably lead the client to successfully implement the changes he or she desires after NLP therapy.


Is Nlp Effective?


Based on valid, recognized, and established research projects in sociology, linguistics, and psychology, NLP's theories are discredited mainly as pseudo-science. The founders of NLP based their ideas on a sound research project. Still, the scientific community has repeatedly stated that the founders’ comments and responses to inquiries have demonstrated that they do not understand the underlying theories they often cite in their work. Additionally, they have not produced any of their original scientific evidence to support the claims made by NLP theorists or have their programming sessions cause the changes they promise.


Mainstream psychology has established through clinical research, practice, and published works the truth of the subconscious and the importance of understanding its function to help get rid of, treat or change harmful psychological developments in individuals. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and traditional psychotherapy must meet with fairly rigorous professional standards and are predicated on proven methods and psychotherapy theories. At the same time, NLP’s success record is less consistent and based more on anecdotal testimony.


NLP providers generally have a financial interest in promoting NLP's success, so their testimonials may or may not be accurate. Additionally, the results of people that have completed NLP training sessions are mixed. Some studies have shown that patients who participate in NLP have improved psychological symptoms and better quality of life. Still, the majority of studies indicate there is little evidence that NLP can effectively treat any significant 

psychological disorders, like anxiety, insomnia, or drug abuse.


However, while clinical studies have discredited NLP as a legitimate sort of treatment for severe psychological illnesses, NLP continues to be a part of the massive, profitable industry that capitalizes on the demand for self-improvement literature. Tony Robbins, the contemporary self-help, self-improvement, and motivational speaking guru, trained with NLP’s founders and continues to use many of their ideas in his famous seminars.


Regardless of all the negative press reports and scientific criticisms, NLP has spawned a worldwide industry. Companies like NLP Power, The NLP Center, The Empowerment Partnership, and the founders’ own NLP University still advertise and promote their services on the web and supply behavior therapy training to a worldwide audience. Additionally, many corporations and government agencies send employees to NLP-based seminars to coach leadership teams and staff. Thus, while the scientific foundations of NLP are exposed and discredited, these organizations still attract followers and clients who see a benefit in the behavioral changes that result from associating with organizations that provide training in psychological and behavioral change.


Hypnosis


NLP is the medical establishment that accepts pseudo-science, hypnosis, and hypnotherapy as viable behavior therapy methods and therapeutic psychological treatment. Hypnosis is additionally known as hypnotherapy or hypnotic suggestion.


According to the Mayo Clinic, hypnosis is defined as “a trance-like state in which you have heightened focus and concentration...usually through the assistance of a therapist using 

verbal repetition and mental images.”


The word hypnosis springs from the Greek word “hypnos,” which suggests “sleep.” There is some debate about who first developed the idea and practice of hypnosis. Many of us believe hypnosis was first developed in the 19th century. Some people credit the French researcher Etienne Felix d’Henin de Cuvillers, who had hung out trying to know how people in a deep state of relaxation would respond to suggestions to change their behavior. Others have credited James Braid, a Scottish surgeon who has been given credit for first calling the practice “hypnosis.”


Many of the humorous and negative stereotypes of hypnosis are often credited to 18th-century German physician Franz Mesmer. Mesmer conducted many experiments and demonstrations in his efforts to prove what he referred to as “animal magnetism.” He believed an invisible fluid flowed between living animals, people, and plants, which by influencing the direction and rate at which this fluid flowed, he could create behavioral changes. His attempts to prove this so-called “animal magnetism” were eventually discredited, and his practices were shown to be dishonest and lacking in any scientific validity. However, his earlier efforts eventually led to further research. Additionally, his influence has been long-lived—we still refer to excellent artistic performances or engrossing dialog as “mesmerizing.”


Contemporary hypnotherapy consists of two functions: Induction and suggestion. During hypnotic induction, the therapist attempts to put the patient into a deep state of relaxation. Once the patient has achieved a hypnotic state, the therapist makes suggestions designed to assist the patient achieve the specified behavior.


What Are the Uses of Hypnosis?


Patients under hypnosis feel calm and relaxed and are generally more open to suggestions. The most common hypnosis uses are resolving problems related to physical illnesses, behavioral issues, and psychological ailments.


_
      

 Physical conditions: Hypnotherapy can help patients who are having difficulty with any of the following physical illnesses:


Chronic or acute pain


Many patients diagnosed with atrophic arthritis or post-surgical pain have benefited from hypnotherapy by altering the patients’ perception of pain. In one experiment, a patient under hypnosis was instructed not to feel any pain in his arm. The patient then placed his arm in a tub of very cold drinking water and was able to leave it for several minutes without experiencing any pain. Patients in the same experiment who had not been hypnotized had to get their arms out of the water after only a couple of seconds.


Pain-related to medical procedures


Patients undergoing dental care, childbirth, or other painful medical procedures have benefited from undergoing hypnotherapy before treatment.


Migraine headaches


Because stressful conditions often trigger migraine headaches, hypnotherapy can help reduce their frequency and intensity without medication's side effects.


Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)


This condition can cause considerable discomfort. Although not effective as a long-term treatment on its own, hypnotherapy can help patients resolve short-term pain related to IBS.


Side effects of cancer treatment


Chemotherapy to treat certain forms of cancer can cause considerable discomfort and nausea. Hypnotherapy has been effective in helping some patients alleviate these side effects.


Skin conditions, including warts, psoriasis, and eczema


Some skin conditions are often triggered by stress and anxiety. In these cases, helping patients find how to resolve chronic anxiety can help relieve symptoms.


_
      


Behavioral changes

: Hypnosis also can be used to effect behavioral changes, like in treatments for the following conditions:


Insomnia


Patients affected by insomnia can also be affected by stress-related conditions. Hypnotherapy can help patients learn new habits and techniques to assist the patient sleep off without medication.


Smoking, overeating, bed-wetting


Addictions and other behavioral problems are often difficult to resolve using only therapy and drugs. Hypnosis can help patients learn to change their behavior in areas where they have been resistant.


_
      


Emotional and psychological disorders:

 Finally, hypnotherapy is usually used to treat the psychological state problems listed below.


Stress and anxiety


Stress and anxiety disorders are often treated with medication. However, such treatment may only address symptoms and might end in harmful side effects. Hypnosis can provide an additional source of relief for patients affected by this condition.


Phobias


Phobias are a problematic and sophisticated area of psychology. Though there is no single account of why someone may have developed a particular fear, hypnotherapy can help the patient change their perceptions and reactions to triggers.


Post-traumatic Stress Disorder


Also referred to as PTSD, this condition is analogous to worry and anxiety disorders but usually caused by an acute or sudden traumatic experience. The consequences can cause long-term problems, and hypnotherapy can help patients find healthier ways of responding.


Grief and loss


Grief and loss can cause ongoing challenges for several people. By helping patients refocus their attention, hypnotherapy can aid in a quicker recovery.


Depression


There are many causes of depression. Sometimes patients are in difficult circumstances, while others could also be psychologically predisposed to depression; often, it is a combination of factors. Regardless, hypnosis can help patients redirect their mental focus and find relief.


Dementia


Patients with dementia may have trouble concentrating and 

remembering. Hypnosis is effective at helping them reconnect with familiar surroundings.


Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)


The growing concerns about this psychological ailment have resulted from the quickened and disjointed pace of labor and life in environments that use digital technology and video. Hypnosis can help patients adjust to a less stressful setting and develop a longer attention span.


Myths About Hypnosis


Dispelling the various stereotypes of hypnosis is that the initiative in understanding this area of psychotherapy. The sideshow practitioner with an enormous mustache who dangles or spins a large object with a spiral design in front of the patient until they fall into his spell occurs only in movies.


_
       


Myth #1—Patients cannot remember what happens during hypnosis.




It is not true that patients under hypnosis cannot remember anything once they are pulled back out of the hypnotic state. Patients under hypnosis are generally fully conscious of everything during hypnosis and remember everything that happens during a session.


In some cases, as when a hypnotherapist suggests to the patient that he or she forgets certain things that occurred immediately before or during a session, the patient may experience selective amnesia, but this effect may result from a deliberate effort to help the patient get over a psychological difficulty. In most cases, it is limited and temporary. Amnesia has been reported in some cases, but it is infrequent.


_
       




Myth #2—Hypnosis can help patients remember forgotten events.




Television crime shows often portray psychics and hypnotherapists' facility to unravel crimes by helping traumatized victims recall details from the crime scene that allow lawyers and cops to crack the case. Still, the thought that hypnosis can help patients retrieve forgotten details or memories of past events has been largely disproven.


There is some evidence that hypnosis can help improve overall memory. However, studies have shown that in instances in which hypnosis has been used to help patients retrieve lost memories or achieve so-called “past life regression,” the results were more likely false memories or fictitious recollections resulting from suggestions in the trance state.


_
      


Myth #3—Hypnotherapists can put you under


a spell and cause you to do anything.




It is a myth that anyone can be often hypnotized against their will or forced to act in ways that violate their beliefs or morality. So for hypnosis to be effective, the patient must be a willing and active participant. Similarly, when the patient is fully hypnotized, the hypnotist does not have complete control over the patient's actions under hypnosis. Hypnotized people could also be less inhibited to act in certain ways, but even in a trance state, patients aren't able to act in ways they believe are wrong or violate their morals or ethics.


_
       


Myth #4—Hypnosis can give patients superhuman abilities.




Popular culture sometimes portrays the limitless possibilities that will open up to patients who undergo hypnosis. Film and TV may display hypnotherapy sessions in which the patient is convinced that when he or she comes out of the trance state, they will be able to 

run faster than a car, be smarter than anyone else at work, lift automobiles, or resist bullets. Hypnotherapy can help patients improve their performance in a particular area—both physical and mental. But it cannot allow anyone to exceed the bounds of their own physical or intellectual abilities.


Facts About Hypnosis


In actual practice, hypnotherapy is far less dramatic and exciting than the portrayals in popular film and TV. Many of us enter a hypnotic state every day. A hypnotic state is defined as a relaxed and focused mental state. The subject is exceptionally calm, focused, vulnerable to suggestion, and less likely to be influenced by hesitations or inhibitions.


For example, whenever you sit down at home or in a movie theater to watch a movie, you enter a hypnotic state. As the film begins, your mind shifts its attention from concerns about work, family, relationships, bills, and other daily problems to the story that is close to unfolding. Significantly if the lights are dimmed, and out of doors, interference from sounds and activity is muffled or blocked. Your mind gradually relaxes and begins to shift its focus more and more to the film, until at some point, you are entirely engrossed by the images, sounds, and events on the screen. Often during these episodes, we enter such a deep state of hypnosis that we react to scenes of violence, comedy, or shock as if they were happening.


In professional environments, many contemporary work gurus have developed the thought of “flow.” When you are at work focused on what you are doing that it ceases to require any strain or effort, you have entered a state of “flow.” Once you are in this state, you can manufacture top-quality work, which will typically seem excessively tricky. What’s more, you will be able to sustain this high level of 

productivity for hours on end and even derive an intense sense of delight and happiness. This fact, too, is a state of hypnosis.


Hypnosis is typically used in combination with psychotherapy. During psychotherapy, patients may have explored many of the painful or difficult thoughts or feelings they have been experiencing. Under hypnosis, they might be more willing to explore these areas in additional depth, which may cause a far better resolution. There are two primary forms of hypnosis:


•
      

 Suggestion therapy: this type of hypnosis uses suggestions to help patients change their behavior, like smoking or overeating, or to change their perceptions, as in cases when patients are experiencing pain and discomfort.


•
      

 Analysis therapy: this type of hypnosis is used to place patients in a deep state of relaxation to feel more willing to discuss some thoughts and feelings that might be hidden in their subconscious. This type of hypnosis is often used to help treat psychological and mood disorders, mainly when used before psychotherapy.


Hypnotherapy


What Happens During Hypnotherapy?


In a typical session of hypnotherapy, the therapist will begin reviewing the patient’s goals for treatment. Once you and the therapist are clear about the explanations for seeking hypnotherapy, he or she is going to start talking in a calm, soothing, and delicate voice, usually describing images and scenes to help the patient relax and feel safe. This first step is meant to create a “receptive state” in the mind of the patient. Once the therapist sees you have attained 

this state of relaxation and receptivity, he or she is going to begin suggesting ways you would possibly achieve your goals. These suggestions may include constructing visual images in your mind in which you see yourself successfully attaining the behavior or condition you have identified as your goal.


For example, the session may begin with the therapist, asking you to shut your eyes, relax, and abandon any tension. Depending on the personal information you have shared with your therapist. They will then begin to suggest locations or events that you associate with feelings of safety, relaxation, and calm—maybe the beach or the ocean, an area in your home, or some kind of music or activity.


Once the patient has achieved a trance state described as a state between sleep and wakefulness, the hypnotherapist can make suggestions. If the therapist suggests eating a cheeseburger, you will experience the meal and taste; if the therapist means that your nose is heavily congested from a cold, you may alter your voice when you talk. Alternatively, the therapist may ask deep and probing questions on a sensitive area of your life that you usually are uncomfortable discussing. In a hypnotic state, you may find it much easier to open up.


Throughout the session of hypnotherapy, the patient feels an entire lifting of inhibitions. They will be very suggestible and willing to act in ways that generally will be embarrassing or uncomfortable. Yet, at no time does the patient lose consciousness or forget that they are engaged in a session with a hypnotherapist. The effectiveness of hypnotherapy lies in its ability to induce the patient to enter a state where their inhibitions are lowered so that the psychological defenses they have built up would not prevent them from saying or doing things that will help them resolve their problem. With enough practice and training, many patients can eventually practice self-

hypnosis as part of a program of ongoing self-care.


Is Hypnotherapy Effective?


As discussed above, hypnosis is used in a relatively limited number of situations to help people deal with pain, stress, depression, grief, or anxiety. Specific physical ailments like irritable bowel syndrome, overcome chemotherapy-related consequences to cancer treatment or affect behavioral changes like quitting smoking and losing weight.


Although hypnotherapy has been recognized as having valid and proven clinical results, it is still viewed as a supplementary or secondary treatment line following a full program of psychotherapy or cognitive behavioral therapy.


Also, some people are more likely to profit from hypnotherapy than others. People who exhibit higher levels of activity in the prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the brain's parietal regions are more likely to be suggestible under hypnosis. These areas of the brain regulate functions like memory, perception, emotions, and task learning. Overall, researchers have developed the following statistical analysis of the effectiveness of hypnosis in the general population:


•
       

Approximately 15% of individuals report high degrees of responsiveness to hypnosis.


•
       

Approximately 10% of adults are immune to hypnosis or impossible to hypnotize.


•
       

People who exhibit the capacity to enjoys fantasies generally experience more enjoy hypnosis.


•
       

Children are usually easier to hypnotize than adults.


Drawbacks of Hypnotherapy


In some instances, hypnosis may very well cause harm.


For example, patients with symptoms of psychopathy or who experience hallucinations or delusions could also be hard to control or may experience a worsening of their condition under hypnosis. Some psychiatric disorders may require medication, and in these cases, hypnosis could also be an ineffective treatment. Hypnosis is additionally not recommended for patients who are currently abusing substances or under the influence of medicine or alcohol.


Patients who wish to use hypnosis as a way of pain control should be examined by a physician to make sure they are not experiencing any serious problems that may require surgical or medical intervention.


Finally, hypnotherapy can cause the patient to make false or fictitious memories or experience intense emotions. Using hypnosis to treat severe psychological disorders, like those outlined in the Dark Triad or other dissociative disorders, is usually considered potentially harmful and dangerous.


Brainwashing


If hypnosis is the benevolent uncle of social influence techniques, brainwashing is the red-headed stepchild. Technically, “brainwashing” isn't a term that has been officially accepted either by the legal, scientific, or medical communities.


Currently, those seeking to legitimize studies in this area of human behavior control have developed the more accurate term, “coercive persuasion.” Other words include thought control, re-education, thought reform, menticide, and mind control. Regardless, brainwashing is a term used to describe efforts to forcibly transform someone’s beliefs, values, views, and attitudes using a combination of physical violence and psychological manipulation.


Notice that no patient who is unwilling to enter a suggestive state 

can be hypnotized in hypnosis, and no hypnotherapist can force an involuntary patient to become hypnotized. Brainwashing represents the antithesis.


Brainwashing techniques are used theoretically in situations when the subject is most unwilling to change his or her behavior. In these cases, brainwashing techniques are explicitly used to force the issue to change against their will without their full knowledge or consent.


According to the Merriam Webster Online Dictionary, “brainwashing” has two distinct definitions:


_
      

 A forcible indoctrination to induce someone to give up fundamental political, social, or religious beliefs and attitudes and to accept contrasting regimented ideas.


_
       

Persuasion by propaganda or salesmanship.


The History of Brainwashing


Historically, the term “brainwashing” was coined to explain a person's forcible conversion from one set of ideological, political, or religious beliefs to a different one. Because the brainwashing process requires the use of force and is known as a process in which the subject is an unwilling participant, it involves using in-depth and excessive behavior therapy tools and techniques. These techniques may include:


_
      

 Efforts to regulate the subject’s physical environment and this control could also be exerted by forcing the issue to inhabit a jail cell or another physically isolated location. The brainwasher controls physical access to the site; the subject is either not free to leave or is subjected to constant monitoring.


_
      

 Efforts to regulate the subject’s social environment. For instance, the matter could also be isolated from associates, 

friends, and family members, combined with limitations and controls on the type of stories and knowledge they can access.


_
      

 A daily regimen designed to impose unquestioning obedience to authority and absolute humility. Such regimens may require daily sessions of “education” or indoctrination in which all responses are closely monitored, with none tolerance for dissent or deviation.


_
      

 A system of social rewards and punishments to pressure subjects into conforming to the new ideology.


_
      

 A system of physical and psychological punishments to discourage non-conformity. Such penalties may range on the mild end of the spectrum from social rejection, shunning, criticism, and ostracism; to more severe actions like deprivation of food, sleep, or social contact; to extreme measures like physical beatings, bondage, stress positions, and torture.


_
       

All brainwashing systems require continual reinforcement to achieve their objectives.


In this sense, the goal of brainwashing is to forcibly convince the subject that their way of thinking is wrong. To completely break down and eradicate their former personality and worldview, then exchange their psychological makeup by rehabilitating them with rewards, punishments, and re-education to encourage a behavior change.


The term “brainwashing” first came into use in the American conflict regarding the emergence of communism and China's eventual communist takeover. In 1950, the Miami Herald published a story entitled “Brain-washing Tactics Force Chinese Into Ranks of Communist Party.” The article stated that Mao Zedong, the Chinese communist leader, had used ancient methods of torture to force the 

Chinese people to become mindless drones of the communist political and military machine.


The article also warned that everybody was now vulnerable to these techniques that would turn anyone into a person's robot serving alien, hostile, or foreign interests. Worse still, there would be no external evidence to the casual observer that somebody had been brainwashed. This story preceded earlier American political movements to suppress communism's spread of communism by prohibiting people who had been identified as having political or social views described as liberal, socialist, or communist from working in schools, libraries, journalism, or entertainment.


Subsequently, during the Korean War against the communist state of North Korea, which was a part of the Cold War, a high-ranking American officer was shot down, captured, and, along with many other prisoners of war, held in prison camps run by agents of communist governments.


A year after this high-profile event, many of those American POWs had signed false confessions in which they stated that they had committed a series of war crimes against North Korean civilians. Through the media, the American public expressed shock. This reaction worsened when 5,000 of the 7,200 known American POWs petitioned the U.S. government to end the war.


The height of terror came when 21 of the POWs refused to repatriate after their release, choosing instead to stay in communist territory. At this point, the threat of brainwashing became very real and palpable, and these fears have contributed to American domestic and policy disputes ever since.


Films like Invasion of the Body Snatchers and The Manchurian Candidate are classics of American theater and have popularized 

notions that the threat of brainwashing is everywhere and sometimes undetectable. The American political and intellectual establishment struggled to understand how this apparent radical shift in numerous people's worldviews had occurred. Eventually, they legitimized the idea by including brainwashing as dissociation in the Third Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III).


However, scientists who studied the POWs' behavior in prison camps during the Korean War concluded that the behavioral change had an easier explanation—the soldiers who had signed false confessions had been tortured. In reaction to those events, the military became convinced that its soldiers were only weak and needed to be trained to resist brainwashing efforts. As a result, they developed a program referred to as the Survival, Evasion, Resistance, Escape plan, or SERE, which was designed to organize soldiers for resistance against future efforts at brainwashing and indoctrination.


Another aspect of brainwashing that is often overlooked is the long legacy of human experimentation in the 20th century. In America, prisoners, people from poor and marginalized populations, people with intellectual impairments or thought or mood disorders, newborn children, and many others were often unknowingly and unwillingly subjected to medical and scientific experiments to develop vaccines or tests psychological or behavioral theories.


The former Soviet Union also conducted many controversial scientific experiments on its vast population of political prisoners. Third Reich also routinely used Jewish prisoners in concentration camps to conduct human experiments to test a wide range of theories. Some of these experiments were immediate results of the emergence of the fear of communist brainwashing and were developed as official intelligence programs administered by the 

Central Intelligence Agency(CIA).


For example, MKUltra was the code name for a CIA-backed research program from 1953 until 1973. Under the guise of fighting brainwashing, the CIA involved test subjects without their knowledge by using them to check mind-altering substances like LSD, hypnosis, sensory deprivation, psychological and sexual assault, and even torture. The CIA used facilities at hospitals, universities, prisons, and other private and public institutions. The theoretical justification was to develop drugs and brainwashing techniques to be used in clandestine operations, but the program was eventually pack up after a congressional investigation.


Regardless, the thought that brainwashing should be a part of a comprehensive international diplomacy package has been part of the American military, political, and intelligence policies in virtually every conflict since the end of the Cold War. A lot of these policies are still in use today.


Despite the shuttering of MKUltra by Congress in the 1970s, many of the techniques developed at that point were employed in post-9/11 interrogations of terrorism suspects at Abu Ghraib Prison in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. The War on Terrorism began with a brutal interrogation of a suspected Al-Qaeda terrorist using the playbook of conflict counterespionage and brainwashing techniques that included physical torture, sleep deprivation, and other forms of behavior control, which led to a series of confessions by the subject, all of which clothed to be false.


Brainwashing Today


The misadventures of military and intelligence officials convinced of the power of brainwashing and torture to uncover valuable information that will protect national security interests have been in 

the news almost continuously for several years. However, brainwashing is additionally defined as “persuasion by propaganda or salesmanship,” and its more subversive presence has resulted from the increasingly cultish nature of up to date American society.


Less dramatic examples of brainwashing occur on a way more frequent and regular basis in everyday American society. American life has become increasingly cultish or, as some people like to say, tribal. Due to massive corruption and ongoing news stories of political crimes, scandals, and failures in virtually every American institution, many of us became disillusioned.


Because we all need social acceptance and can't help but answer the stress and wishes of contemporary society, many of us who believe they are building successful careers and establishing a network of friends and associates don't realize a cult has recruited them until they are so isolated from their friends and family that legal or maybe military intervention is required to extract them. Even the relations and friends of these who have joined cults and died fighting for their leaders' ideals may argue in all these cases whether any brainwashing was involved. Often, people act on their initiative to hitch cults or new religious movements of their discretion.


For example, in the 1970s, Patricia Hearst, an American heiress and daughter of the prominent and influential media magnate William Randolph Hearst were placed on trial and sentenced to prison for her part in joining a domestic terrorist group and participating in violent criminal attacks. In her trial, she claimed she had been brainwashed. However, the court was disinclined to take claims of brainwashing as a legitimate defense for several reasons.


The foundations of brainwashing were primarily tenuous and shadowy, so proving a claim of brainwashing according to the 

standards of established legal precedent is extremely difficult. Additionally, the courts were not eager to set such a precedent because they feared it might open a floodgate of defendants claiming, “not guilty because of brainwashing.”


Although the court rejected her defense, most of the people regarded her case sympathetically. She had been kidnapped and held at gunpoint by an armed gang, so her case stood out because the most blatant case in which a brainwashing defense could be considered valid. She received a reduced sentence and was eventually pardoned for her part in the crime.


Another example of brainwashing by cultish indoctrination is that the Unification Church, a spiritual organization headed by the Reverend Sun Yung Moon, or “The Moonies.” Often portrayed sarcastically and comically in American films, many Americans have told stories of joining the Moonies to react to disillusionment and lack of purpose in their lives.


In one case, an American university student said that despite having been raised Jewish, he was quickly convinced that the Moonies were going to succeed in their efforts to save the world and have become what he described as an “off-the-charts, fly-a-plane-into-the-World-Trade-Center-if-Father-ordered-you-to Moonie” (Father is the title cult members use for the Reverend Sung Yun Moon). According to this cult member, he “was sure they would not be able to make [him] betray Father. [He] wanted to convince [his] parents that [he] wasn't brainwashed or mind-controlled.” Eventually, however, he left the cult and have become a psychological state counselor specializing in treating and counseling other former cult members.


Another example of an up-to-date cult is that the Reverend Jim Jones ran the People’s Temple. He had led his followers to 

Jonestown, Guyana, in 1978. Jones and his followers were highly idealistic and vehemently opposed many of the political establishment's corruption and abuses. They saw tremendous opposition from relations and members of Congress.


As two Congress members flew to South America to intervene in what they saw as a potentially dangerous and worsening situation, almost 1,000 of the cult members attending chose to commit suicide by voluntarily drinking poison-laced punch. Hence the term “drinking the Kool-Aid” to express the thought of incomprehensible indoctrination.


The fate of Branch Davidians under the leadership of David Koresh in Texas was similarly apocalyptic, with Branch Davidians choosing to die as martyrs for their belief in the sanctity of David Koresh’s preaching instead of surrender to American military forces.


Even in these examples, many of the surviving participants, their family members, experts in the field argue about whether these cases are examples of brainwashing. Since those that join these cults often do so as an act of discretion. Additionally, many cultish associations emerge in ways in which are less visible.


The social psychologist Alexandra Stein joined a political organization called “the O.” At the time, she didn't know that it had been a cult. Still, the organization wielded considerable control over her life throughout the 1980s. In addition to keeping her sleep-deprived by requiring her to carry multiple jobs, she was also isolated from her friends. In retrospect, she blamed vulnerabilities resulting from her sense of loss and confusion and only realized later that the cult leaders were exploiting her.


With all of its highly personalized, targeted advertising, the increase of social media has allowed the business to maximize the thought of 

brainwashing as “persuasion by propaganda or salesmanship” to unprecedented degrees. Advertising is nothing new, but mainstream marketing and advertising have moved from newspapers, television, and radio into virtually everyone's personal lives.


The U.S. military’s huge budgets supporting research and development in digital global satellite communication, combined with successful marketing campaigns that have made Apple, Microsoft, and Google more powerful than many sovereign governments and the use of Big Data Analytics to tailor advertising to too high levels of scientifically accurate psychological profiling have transformed the advertising and marketing business. Even President Barack Obama once commented that U.S. spies no longer want to kill people; they want to sell products.


Unfortunately, many of the erosions and breakdowns in traditional society, like gender roles, challenge authority. A general sense of lawlessness and absence of accountability, combined with digital technology’s capability to encourage increasingly isolated and alienating individualized lifestyles, means that each of us is increasingly vulnerable to the malevolent abuses of brainwashing and cult recruitment.


Challenges Of Brainwashing In The Future


From the previous section, brainwashing is a problematic area in which to gain any firm understanding. Its origins as a reaction to the unprecedented rise of communism in the 1950s make it a reasonably new human psychological development.


Most psychologists agree that it is possible to brainwash a person or a group of people successfully. However, they also agree that popular portrayals of brainwashing are inaccurate, both in terms of the likelihood of success and the severity of the influence. 

Specifically, the acute measures and the extreme goals of brainwashing rarely occur unless they are deliberately created. Furthermore, as patients who willingly undergo hypnosis to recall repressed memories are found more likely to invent fictitious memories easily, brainwashing subjects are not expected to experience any real conversion, except conversions resulting from forcible, violent threats and torture.


Also, government programs like MKUltra are shown to supply unreliable results. Such political and military failures and catastrophes should end in the cessation of such abuses, but often they do not. However, arguments supporting indoctrination and brainwashing will lose ground as long as their use continues to perpetuate these problems.


Regardless, the increasing presence of cults in American society is certainly a cause for concern. Unregulated groups beyond the reach of oversight agencies often operate according to alternative worldviews not based on legally or psychologically sound philosophies. Additionally, the increase of digital technology and social media has given them more communication tools that will likely increase their power and ability to recruit new members.


However uncomfortable it is going to be, we must also acknowledge that even the people we all know and love the most may have beliefs we never really understand or agree with, leading them to join groups that support alternative lifestyles. Brainwashing cannot always explain these actions; maintaining our freedom and independence requires that we must all be willing to tolerate the danger of dissent.


As long as society continues to develop according to cultish patterns, encourages greater social alienation and isolation, and fails 

to ensure political and legal accountability, unregulated social influence will continue to pose potentially grave risks.









What Is Emotional Manipulation?


Now that we have covered the essential foundations of dark psychology, including the concept of incredibly dangerous psychopathy and the irreversible movement toward the Dark Singularity. So you may feel a sense of relief that these social problems are identified in a system for addressing them. Additionally, you will also breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that the most severe offenders are somewhat rare. Your chances of encountering them on a day to day are fairly low.


If you agree that knowledge of dark psychology traits is a good initiative toward protecting yourself from these dangers—that is great! Experience is power, more so in the modern era than ever.


However, dark psychology's reality is that lower levels of those deviant personality traits are prevalent. Worse yet, they are often legitimized by the very institutions and other people we rely upon to deal with such violations. Especially in the contemporary environment, technology has fostered and encouraged alienation and anti-social lifestyles. Concerning the unprecedented degree that they now provide a potentially viable and sustainable means of monetary and social support; understanding how dark psychology manifests itself can differentiate between success and failure.


Types of Emotional Manipulation


This chapter will explore how people who exhibit deviant personality traits may manipulate and control others.


Discussing accurately manipulative behavior requires that we examine this problem from two perspectives: from the standpoint of psychotherapy and everyday relationships. We will begin by 

discussing different types of emotional manipulation using clinical terminology.


According to well-established theories of behavior therapy and cognitive learning, many clinical psychologists have studied and classified manipulative behavior. We will look first at some of the techniques identified by a few of those psychologists before watching real-world examples and signs that somebody is trying to control you.


Characteristics of a Manipulative Relationship


First, one theory states that emotional manipulation is actually a one-sided activity in which the manipulator forms all of the effort to make, execute, and sustain a manipulative relationship. Such relationships generally have three defining characteristics:


_
      


Concealment

: The manipulator's true motivations—aggression and control—are concealed by behavior that appears friendly and helpful.


It is harder to conceal problems with aggression and control in our personal, intimate relationships, friendships, and relationships with family members. These types of relationships are more likely to develop in the workplace or your community of business owners and their staff or other professionals.


For example, you might encounter a co-worker who, on the surface, is usually friendly to you at work. This person may always be willing to reserve an area for you at the table during lunch break or may still appear at your cubicle with a smile and offer a lot of encouragement and advice. This kind of conduct in itself could also be a good sign. However, if this relationship ultimately results in a friendship outside of the office, an emotional manipulator may misinterpret 

your intent.


In the less-regulated world outside of the workplace, emotional predators may exploit the trust they have established by making unreasonable demands on your time, posing for favors, and putting pressure on you to agree by suggesting there might be repercussions at work. A very gifted manipulator will find ay to make this threatening behavior look and feel friendly and perfectly reasonable until you have got been too badly compromised to take any action to reverse course.


_
      


Profiling

: The manipulator will have studied the victim's vulnerabilities so that they will be able to exploit them more effectively.


This type of predatory conduct has become much worse in the current environment of surveillance and social networking sites. Later in this chapter, we will examine several character traits that make people more attractive targets for emotional manipulation.


Often in the work environment, this type of personality can happen without your awareness. Mainly if you are employed in a large company, anyone who has access to personnel records or other data sources may feel they need the luxury to profile you. When they do finally approach, they will appear relatively calm and confident.


If someone with whom you have had little or no direct contact seems to understand a lot about you, you ought to take care. Often, being overly enthusiastic, paying you a lot of compliments, and telling you that you have earned an excellent reputation may be a technique used to hide the manipulator's true intentions.


_
      


Amorality

: The manipulator will possess high degrees of amorality and a lack of remorse, both of which enable behavior that is ruthless, cunning, and treacherous.


Often, we expect that a simple, polite request to cease harmful, rude, or disruptive behavior should be sufficient to end predatory or violative misconduct. Although we could also be right, Dark Triad personalities who lack empathy find it easy to interact in amoral behavior. Even worse, far away from feeling any remorse due to committing abuses, they often feel an excellent sense of joy, victory, and accomplishment. As the saying goes, such reactions add insult to injury.


Further, this sort of dishonest and illegal behavior could also be rewarded in a competitive business environment. Meanwhile, the efforts of diligent, honest employees may go unrewarded, and their complaints of abuse may end in punishments levied against them instead of the perpetrators.


Specific Type of Emotional Manipulation


In these major categories of emotional manipulation techniques, psychologists have also identified a good range of more subtle variations that we all likely encounter daily. These techniques include:


_
      

 Lying: Dark Triad personalities, particularly psychopaths, are highly skilled at lying and cheating, so often, we might not detect their intent until it is too late. Watch out for those that have demonstrated a pattern of dishonesty.


_
      

 Lying by omission: Lying by omission may be a little more subtle. The predator might not say anything untrue but may withhold information that is necessary for an attempt to cause you to fail.


_
      

 Denial: Often, the damage from emotional manipulation is inflicted after the fact. When you confront someone with 

evidence of their dishonesty and abuse, their refusal to admit wrongdoing can cause even more significant psychological harm.


_
      

 Rationalization: The rise in popular journalism has led to the expansion of PR and marketing firms who produce “spin” to deflect criticism in both political and company environments. Rationalization may be a sort of spin, in which a manipulator explains away his or her abuse.


_
      

 Minimization: Like rationalization, devaluation is a kind of denial in which the predator understands his or her offense's seriousness.


_
      

 Selective attention and/or inattention: Manipulators will pick and choose which parts of an argument or debate should be considered so that only their views are represented.


_
      

 Diversion: Manipulators often resist giving straight answers to questions, particularly when their victims confront them. Instead, they are going to divert the conversation to another topic or change the issue altogether.


_
      

 Evasion: More severe than a diversion, a manipulative person confronted with his or her own guilt will often completely evade responsibility by using long rambling responses crammed with so-called “weasel words,” like “most people would say,” “according to my sources,” or other phrases that falsely legitimize their excuses.


_
      

 Covert intimidation: Many manipulative people will make implied threats to discourage further inquiries or resolution.


_
      

 Guilt-tripping: a proper form of emotional manipulation, a manipulator, will exploit the integrity and 

conscientiousness of the victim by accusing them of being too selfish, too irresponsible, or not caring enough.


_
      

 Shaming: Although shaming is often used to cause social change when large corporations or governments advance abusive or discriminatory policies, manipulators may plan to intimidate their victims by using sharp criticism, sarcastic comments, or insults to make them feel bad.


_
      

 Blaming the victim: This tactic has become increasingly common. When a victim accuses a predator of abuse, the predator will plan to turn it around by creating a scenario in which the victim alone is liable for the harm that came to him. The predator can also attempt to accuse the victim of being the aggressor by complaining about the violation.


_
      

 Playing the victim: Using the other tactic of blaming the victim, the predator will lure a conscientious person into a trap by pretending to have been grievously wounded and cultivating feelings of sympathy. However, the real plan is to take advantage of the caring nature of the conscientious person by toying with their emotions.


_
      

 Playing the servant: This tactic is common in environments marked by a strict, well-established chain of command, just like the military. Predators become skilled at manipulating this technique by creating a persona of suffering and nobility, in which their wrong actions are justified as a duty, obedience, and honor.


_
      

 Seduction: This system does not always need to involve sexual conquest or intimacy. Emotional predators may use flattery and charm to convince people to do their bidding, and they often search for people with low self-esteem.


_
      

 Projection: This term is used in psychotherapy. Predators who use this system will search for victims to 

use as scapegoats. When the manipulator does something wrong and is confronted, he or she will “project” his or her guilt onto the victim in an attempt to make the victim appear as the responsible party.


_
      

 Feigning innocence: This system is often used as a part of a technique of denial. Under questioning, the manipulator will “play innocent” by pretending that any violation was unintentional or that they weren't the party who committed the offense. A talented manipulator who lacks morality and empathy are often very successful at planting the seed of doubt.


_
      

 Feigning confusion: This system also can be used as a part of a technique of denial. Under questioning, the manipulator will “play dumb” or pretend to be confused about the conflict or dispute's central point. By creating confusion, the manipulator hopes to wreck the arrogance of his or her victim.


_
      

 Peer pressure: Using claims, whether real or not, that the victim’s friends, associates, or “everyone else” is doing something, the manipulator will put pressure on his victim to change his or her behavior or attitude.


Signs That You Are Being Manipulated


All of us are potentially vulnerable to emotional manipulation by people that exhibit characteristic signs of dark psychology. Victimization can occur in our everyday relationships with co-workers, bosses and supervisors, relations, and significant others. Emotional manipulation also can occur in professional relationships with people we regard as usually trustworthy—such as sales representatives, government officials, and other representatives of institutions like medical facilities, banks, businesses, schools, and 

law firms.


Emotional predators share one common trait: they look out for people whom they know are conscientious, dependable, loyal, honest, and reliable. People with these character traits are the best to control because all of the tricks in the manipulator’s toolbox are explicitly designed to take advantage of those emotional and psychological characteristics. More importantly, emotional predators lack empathy or morality. They do not regard their abuses as shocking or unacceptable; instead, they consider the overabundance of conscientious people as “job security” and a golden opportunity.


Emotional predators are often found in all walks of life. For their lives, they have learned the way to adapt, blend in, and even achieve high levels of professional and financial success in the “straight world.” Remember that having a legitimate and bonafide expectation that people will be honest in their dealings with you means you are a conscientious person. Although you occupy the superior position, emotional predators are highly skilled at exploiting this expectation and avoiding detection and/or punishment.


As we have seen, emotionally manipulative people use various techniques and methods to gain power in relationships. What's more, the people you are closest to and most familiar with—people whom you ought to be able to trust the most—are in the best position to use emotional manipulation to take advantage of your trust. Establishing trust and familiarity is one of the most important aspects of a successful effort to take advantage of someone’s emotional vulnerability, then manipulate them either for personal gain or just out of pure malice.


Of course, just because this sort of abuse has become common does not mean that you should automatically and necessarily regard all of your friends and trusted associates as predators and manipulators. Nor do you have to give in to the temptation to consider being conscientious, law-abiding, and honest as a problem. However, victims of emotional manipulation are often unaware that they are being exploited and abused, so it is essential to find out how to recognize the signs of manipulation.


By finding ways of resolving disputes and conflicts that are healthier or by devising an exit strategy to guard yourself against any further damage, you can achieve a greater degree of happiness and success. You may also avoid many of the issues that plague people unaware of what is happening to them or who are intimidated into not reacting.


Whether in your work life or personal life, you may have been exploited or violated by an emotional predator. The prevalence of this deviant behavior and the degree to which it has become considered acceptable is unsettling, to mention but a few. The following list departs from the more theoretical and clinical descriptions of predatory behavior above to supply more vivid examples of the type of conduct that will indicate the presence of emotional manipulation.


Examples of Emotional Manipulation


_
      


Insisting on meeting at certain locations

: Manipulators may attempt to get the upper hand by pressing on a so-called “home-court advantage,” thereby forcing you to function in a less familiar and less comfortable environment that diminishes your personal negotiating power.


Examples:






If you have a dispute with a professional acquaintance or colleague, they may insist on always meeting in their office or at a cafe or restaurant that is more difficult for you to visit.






If you are in a personal relationship, your partner may always insist that you meet him or her at their favorite spot and meet with their friends. They may show little interest in reciprocating when you invite them to participate in a social activity you discover rewarding.






_
      


Premature intimacy or closeness

: The manipulator will immediately shower you with affection and reveal all kinds of intimate secrets.


Examples:






In a personal relationship, the manipulator may introduce themselves using phrases like, “No one has ever made me feel this before. I do know we were made for each other.”






This kind of intimacy and closeness can happen in the professional environment, too. A colleague you do not know to ell may make comments like, “You know, I have been watching you work, and I can see how skilled and talented you are. No one else gives you the credit you deserve.”






_
      


Managing conversations by always requiring you to talk first

: In professional relationships, this is often commonly used as a sales and negotiation technique to mine you for your information to make a more lucrative sale.


Examples:






A salesman may say something like, “Rather than bore 

you with details about our products or services, why don’t you tell me about yourself and the way you think that we can help you?”






In personal relationships, this system is often used to gain an influence advantage. Skilled manipulators will conceal their true motives by saying things like, “I may be wrong, but first, I’d wish to hear your side of the story.”






_
      


Distorting or twisting facts

: Whether in personal or professional relationships, manipulators will use conversational techniques to distort facts in an attempt to make you doubt yourself and back down.


Example:


•
      

 A manipulator may use a phrase like, “I understand how you are feeling. I’d be angry, too. But the reality is, I never made that comment. I don’t think your memory of that conversation is accurate. I do know what you meant to say was that...”


_
      


Intellectual bullying

: An emotional manipulator may use an unnecessarily large volume of statistics, jargon, or other types of factual evidence to impose a way of expertise.


Example:






Someone who is implementing intellectual bullying tactics may say something like, “This isn't a simple decision to make. In addition to all or any legal and financial considerations, you furthermore may need to consider how this may affect people at work and the rest of the family. I do know technology isn't your specialty, but I have already done all the work in that regard. Now, we only have a limited amount of time, and I know how 

important this is for you. I wish we could just take our time and think about it. Fortunately, I have already evaluated all the main concerns, and I can make it very easy for you to make a choice.”






_
      


Bureaucratic bullying

: This system is analogous to intellectual bullying. Unfortunately, this system may indicate that somebody is abusing their position of authority by insisting on placing as many obstacles, red tape, or other impediments in the way of what should be an easy resolution.


Example:






Such an individual may make a press release like, “I understand your concerns, but I might encourage you not to pursue this any longer. You have got a legitimate complaint, but the expenses and time required will likely cost more than you will get reciprocally. Also, if you create any missteps, you may have to spend the next several years filling out paperwork and getting to court hearings.”






_
      


Passive aggression:

 There are many examples of passive-aggressive behavior in conversation in both personal and professional relationships to force you to back down to the predatory efforts of a manipulator.


Examples:






A manipulator may try to make you feel bad for voicing your concerns. By saying something along the lines of, “I understand that you are voicing a crucial objection, but have you ever stopped to think about what is going to happen to the rest of the team if you ultimately get your way?”






Manipulators can also try to discourage you by making light of your problems. For example, “I know how badly you are feeling right now, but before you do anything, make sure you keep it in perspective. You know, this time last year, I used to be facing a crisis ten times worse, and all I did was sit it out.”






_
      


Insults and put-downs

: Manipulators are good at following up rude or mean-spirited comments with sarcasm or another attempt at humor to make it appear to be they were joking.


Example:






“I know you worked hard on the presentation. Regrettably, you wasted so much time, though. But, hey, no worries. I’m sure it will be a great preparation when you interview for your next position.”






_
      


Refusing to take responsibility

: There are various ways a talented manipulator can accomplish this goal by using evasion, denial, or feigning ignorance or confusion.


Examples:






“You didn’t tell me I had to finish the project by today.”






“I know that is not what you wanted, but everyone else agreed that it should be fine this way.”






“What does one mean by accountability? I do not remember discussing any of that with you.”






“Can you explain the problem with this project again? It is too hard for most people to know.”






_
      


Competitive responses

: Manipulators may introduce outside, unrelated issues with convincing you that your concerns are less.


Example:






“I do understand you have been placed in a difficult situation, but you ought to believe me. Right now, you have already passed all the sales goals I wanted to achieve for this year. It is bad enough that you are making me look bad. Now you are forcing me to ignore my very own workload; with great care, I can help you out.”






_
      


Excessive criticism

: Hypercritical people have problems with low self-esteem. They are going to use this system to make them feel better about themselves. Often these efforts are very blatant, obvious, and hurtful.


Examples:






“You shouldn’t wear that. It makes you look fat and ugly.”






“You shouldn’t talk a lot in meetings. You always just end up sounding stupid.”






_
      


Projecting blame

: Manipulators can place you in a position in which you are forced to take responsibility for his or her actions.


Example:






“I know that meeting didn’t go the way you had hoped. I tried to inform you not to pick me to lead the meeting. Next time, you ought to listen to me.”






_
      


Using guilt and ultimatums

: Manipulators do not need to resort to physical violence. Often, delivering a request while making you feel bad can force you to act in ways you otherwise wouldn’t.


Example:






“Remember what happened last year when I asked you to make a decision about where to go for the Christmas holiday? The whole holiday was ruined because you took too long to make a decision, then you made everyone stay 

home rather than taking the trip back home. This year has to change. If you do not decide by the end of the day, we are never going to invite you to another Christmas party again.”






_
      


Indirect communication

: This has become an increasingly common technique used by manipulators and bullies and sometimes involves gossip and rumors.


Example:






“You can ditch the funding for that project we had planned. I know you told me to wait until the meeting tomorrow, but I already talked to the boss and told him it had been a bad idea.”






_
      


The silent treatment

: In the connected world of data communication, many manipulative people will ignore text messages, email messages, and voicemails as a way of letting you know they do not approve of something you have got done.


_
      


Gaslighting

: The manipulator will make blanket statements to draw your credibility and judgment into question. Manipulators are highly adept at lying, then imposing the falsehood on you until you accept it and back don.


Examples:


Suppose you are at work, and you have documented a pattern of workplace violations that are costing you time and money. The manipulator may attempt to gaslight you by first requesting to see the evidence with a sincere expression of concern.






“I see. You have a compelling case. Let me see if I can find what is happening so we will get to the bottom of it.”






Subsequently, using a combination of denial, indirect 

communication, and feigned ignorance or confusion, the manipulator may return to you in a few weeks with a different response.






“I know I agreed with you initially. But I was talking to the other guys. I feel you possibly have a few of the dates wrong. Also, I know it looks like an enormous deal, but most of the other guys said they do this type of thing all the time, and it is never a problem. Wait, what was the law or rule or whatever you were talking about again? It seemed important when you talked about it, but nobody else appeared to know anything about it. I don’t know... Maybe you are just overreacting.”






_
      


Using negative surprises

: many of us in both personal and professional relationships will use “negative surprises” to take care of power in a relationship and manipulate and control people.


Example:


In the workplace, you may have been encouraged by management members to follow a specified path that will lead to a promotion and a raise. After you have put in overtime and gone above and beyond to satisfy all the demands, the boss announces the meeting where you expect to be promoted:






“I know James has been working very hard these past few months and that we all appreciate his inspirational efforts to extend our sales numbers. I'm also glad you are all here to listen to who is going to be promoted to the position of District Manager. We just got word this morning that I will be personally assuming the new role while also maintaining my current position.”






_
       


Playing the martyr

: Manipulators use this system to 

establish control.


Examples:


A manipulator’s initial reaction when you ask them to help with a particular project might be:






“Sure! Great! Let me know how I can help!”






However, once the assignment or project is underway, their comments are going to be entirely different.






“I know I said I was eager to help, but this is too much. This workload is such a burden. I wish I had never agreed.”






You may respond by reminding them that you discussed all the details ahead of time and criticizing their resistance, but their response will likely place the blame on you.






“Of course, I agree. Really, it is not a problem. You are just overly sensitive and paranoid. You shouldn’t worry so much.”






The goal here is to make you look like a wrong person, call your credibility into question, and undermine your authority.









Defending Yourself from Manipulation Techniques


We have come to the final chapter of our book. At this point in your reading, I assume you have a clear understanding of manipulation regarding what it is, how it happens, and its techniques. Maybe you are reading this book because you have been manipulated or feel you are being manipulated. Regardless of the situation, we have come to the most critical chapter: learning to defend ourselves from manipulators. When people realize they have been conducted, they may feel ashamed, weak, used, or stupid. Generally, being manipulated sucks, especially after learning that we have been unconsciously used to help people to further their selfish agendas.


Chronic manipulation can have devastating effects on the victims. The most apparent effect is that the affected person develops a bad feeling about themselves and the world. This fact is often actual, especially for manipulated people and had their bodies or minds abused. Some people stop trusting everyone and everything out of the fear of being used again. Nobody wants to have their worldviews negatively affected by intruders.


All the same, there is some excellent news. The great information is that just like we can put in measures to stop us from falling sick, we can also implement some to prevent and discourage manipulation. Manipulation will only affect us if we allow it or if we fail to acknowledge it before and while it happens. This way often is why I mentioned this chapter as the most important. By identifying manipulation before it occurs, we will retain control over our lives. Even if we are already being manipulated by applying these effective 

anti-manipulation tactics, we will overcome the vice and reclaim our beautiful lives.


We are going to discuss 18 powerful ways to avoid or reverse manipulation. Some of the ideas we shall highlight won't be desirable or effective in every situation. However, with on the brink of 18 suggestions, you are sure to settle on a few, which can be your best bets against these malicious mind controllers. That said and done, allow us to go straight to the first method of avoiding manipulation.


1. Understand your Rights


The main reason that you will feel as if someone is manipulating you is that you will feel as if your rights are violated. However, you would fail even to realize that somebody is operating you if you have no idea what fundamental rights you are entitled to. As long as you stick with your lane and don't harm people or interfere with their lives, you remain on the safe side. Fundamental rights are the appropriate boundaries that outline the extent to which one person can affect another's life. Therefore, one of the most effective ways to keep manipulators away is to know where your rights start and end. Below are a number of the common fundamental human rights:


Everyone has the right to be accorded respect. If you realize that somebody is disrespecting you, it'd be a symbol of manipulation.


Everyone has the right to work out their priorities. If you opt to prioritize yourself, nobody should attempt to interfere with that.


Everyone has the free will to express their wants, opinions, and feelings. As we have already seen, manipulation happens by taking away free will.


Everyone has the right to refuse something without being made to feel guilty. This fact is often vital because if you realize that you don't 

want something, saying “no” should be respected.


Everyone has the right to have opinions that differ from those of others. Disagreements are normal. Therefore, nobody should mistreat you in any way for holding different views.


Everyone has the right to make and live their own healthy and happy life. In short, if anything threatens to take this away, like a toxic friendship, you have got the right to cut it off.


Finally, and important to our topic of avoiding manipulation, everyone has the right to guard themselves against being emotionally, physically, or mentally threatened. If you feel this right is being violated, be free to object and move away.


2. Maintain Your Distance


It is easy to detect a manipulator because they tend to change their colors when faced with different situations or interact with different people. As humans, we are allowed to adapt to conditions and other people. However, with toxic people, their variations are extreme. A manipulator is often highly polite when with you, but once they meet someone they have less regard for, they transform into overly rude or aggressive with them. Similarly, they could seem helpless at one moment but become very controlling in the next. This fact is often a sure red flag that the person is unstable and unreliable, which it'll only be a matter of your time before they extend the same to you.


The best reaction when you encounter such an individual is to keep a healthy distance. A healthy space means you would not necessarily cut them off completely, but you do not put yourself in situations that may make it easy for them to regulate you. You should avoid engaging with such an individual as much as possible and only doing 

it when you have to. We have seen that chronic manipulators do it out of psychological complications, and it'd be easier to avoid them than try to change them. However, this is often a personal choice since the person could be a lover who might feel the need to help them out of their bad habit.


3. Understand Them


It is vital to know that manipulation is often a manifestation of a psychological problem. If you understand something, then you'll determine the way to deal with it. For instance, we don't scold babies for soiling their clothes or keeping us awake all night because we all know it is beyond their control. As they get older, these habits improve. In the same way, you ought to look at a manipulator as someone experiencing a problem with themselves. Manipulative people tend to possess low self-esteem, lower willpower, uncertain reasons to live, and an irresistible urge for chaos and drama.


That said, you ought to not take whatever they do or say offensively. Their way of expression is affected, such it does not go well with ordinary people. One of the explanations they could tend to regulate others is that they feel inferior and wish to harm others to feel better. Others don't even realize that their actions affect others because they lack empathy. In short, if we understand that manipulation is a form of the disease, then we will take any manipulative approaches lightly. In this way, the manipulator doesn't gain any power or control over us.


4. Hide Your Weaknesses


In the introduction part of this chapter, we said that manipulation only occurs if we allow it. One way to enable it to happen is by allowing outsiders to understand our weaknesses. A manipulator’s 

plan is typical to seek out their victims' weaknesses and use them to evoke the sensation of inadequacy, guilt, shame, blame, or weakness. Therefore, not unless it is indispensable, or the person you are opening up to has proven to be real and trustworthy, always keep your shortcomings hidden. The downside to opening up even to real friends is that you never know when the friendship might end.


To some extent, sharing our weaknesses isn't even necessary. Imperfections are a part of being human, and everybody has a share of the same. Therefore, if you can keep the shortfalls to yourself and feel satisfied with it, it is often the best defense against manipulation. After all, everyone has their flaws, and they don't go around preaching about them. Once the manipulator has no shortcuts to accessing our most powerful emotions, they cannot succeed in invading our lives. In short, know what to share with others and what to keep only between you and yourself.


5. Do Not Ask For Permission


In our upbringing, we are always taught to ask for things to be done for us. We had to ask for food instead of preparing it ourselves. We also had to ask for permission before going out or sleeping over at friends’ houses. Requesting authorization was meant to keep us in good standing with everyone by avoiding doing what would otherwise offend them. Unfortunately, this training led to conditioning to do something, and we'd like to hunt permission or validation while adults. Manipulators have taken advantage of this kind gesture and turned it into their artillery. They need us to feel tied to imaginary ideals and rules to consult some authority before taking action. Worse still, they install themselves as these authorities, which we must consult.


Honestly, asking for permission, mostly to do things in one’s 

personal life, is outdated. It is about time we stopped worrying about the opinions of others about our life decisions. Otherwise, if we'd like others to approve or disapprove of all our choices, we get cast into an abyss of confinement.


For example, parents shouldn't decide who their children should marry. While this used to be a friendly gesture in the past, things have changed. Arranged marriages risk putting two people that have no connection together. Such relationships feel like prisons for both partners, and typically, they end in disaster. Therefore, to avoid manipulation of this type, we should always make our decisions without seeking others' opinions (manipulators).


6. Ignore Manipulators


If you can't move far away from an individual you already know is manipulative, apply the shield of ignorance. One of the mistakes that we make when handling such people is giving them the attention they desire. Once they get the attention, they gain the upper hand in initiating the mind poisoning process. Therefore, if you see or suspect that a manipulative person is making moves at you, just ignore them. For example, if someone is giving too many compliments, you are not familiar with them and resort to ignoring them. You can tell them that the compliments are enough and ignore them henceforth.


One risk of ignoring manipulative people is that it'd trigger more aggressiveness in them. They are usually fighting with their inner selves and can pour out the anger if they feel they are being ignored. This fact does not mean that you shouldn't apply ignorance where necessary. On the brighter side, you can ignore them, hoping their human side remains alive. When an average person feels ignored, they pull back and stop their advances. Therefore, assume that this 

is often the response that they are going to give. If they resort to aggression, you can take appropriate action like reporting them. We will come to that later.


7. Judge your Judge


You are the only person in this universe who knows yourself in the best way. Even if scientists studied you for a decade, they might never understand you as much as you know yourself. Do you agree? Well, if you said yes, then learn to trust yourself and stop the narrative of doubting your decisions or instincts. You have learned that a manipulator tries to sow doubt in you through techniques like crazymaking, twisting reality, lying, and gaslighting. If you study these methods well, you will realize they are all pegged on self-doubt. In short, if you trust people more than you trust yourself, it is a recipe for manipulation.


The best way to start trusting in yourself is by removing the power of others to define you. In this world, everyone you meet has a different opinion about you. Imagine what would happen if you believed everything that everybody you meet said about you. You would not only be confused but also hurt. Therefore, specialize in your understanding of yourself and ignore what people think or say about you. Once you have strong beliefs about yourself, it is hard for manipulative people to interfere with you. Your ideas act as the shield against toxic invasion.


8. Record Interactions Toxic People


You might have probably started seeing this as a way that is a bit overboard but trusts me, and it'd prevent psychological torture. Remember, we said that manipulative people have the habit of claiming things and later denying them. They could also say or do 

bad things to you and later turn the tables, so you end up being the wrong person. To beat such incidences, you can record the interactions with the people you have identified as manipulative. Believe it; if you provided evidence that somebody said something while they are at the helm of denying it, you shame them and discourage them from repeating it.


In today’s world of smartphones and computers, recording a talk or phone conversation is as easy as pressing a button. You can keep the conversations you have got with suspicious people. During something like a call, when the manipulation starts, you can start recording. Even in face-to-face conversations, if someone is trying to blackmail you, you can secretly tap the conversation using your phone or discreet devices. If it ever gets to some extent where they begin denying saying or doing something, provide the evidence. This way is often enough to silence them permanently.


9. Always Grab New Opportunities


Today’s society wants people to remain stuck in the same play and store all their eggs in one basket. People around us are busy telling us what to do and what they expect of us. To them, being employed, taking a mortgage, getting everybody is doing is the right thing. To them, being ambitious is deviating from the right way of life, and they start seeing you as an outcast. This manner is often a complex type of manipulation in that they need to indirectly influence your life and make it as predictable as possible. A predictable life is straightforward to invade and control.


Ambitious people are, at times, seen as greedy, selfish, proud, and arrogant. It is not uncommon to have these names branded on hardworking people. The trick to avoiding this form of mind control is to keep grabbing new opportunities and remaining unpredictable. 

Chasing new experiences, building new relationships, starting new businesses, and applying for better jobs keeps an individual independent and on top of their lives. When someone is unpredictable and entirely in control of themselves, manipulative people cannot bring them down. Therefore, grab any new opportunities which present themselves and don't care what others say.


10. Call Them Out


A manipulator may have controlled people for a long time because nobody has ever confronted them. This fact is often an assumption, but it doesn't make the tactic any less significant. Manipulators are often bullies, too, and bullies are weak people that torture others who feel helpless before them. In short, don't let the manipulator feel you know they are using you but fear speaking it up. Allowing them to continue uninterrupted will only increase their power over you also because of the severity of their behavior. When it becomes clear that somebody is trying to mess with your mind, allow them to know that you are uncomfortable with it.


Calling out on the manipulator’s behavior may have several positive effects. First, they will realize that you are awake enough to understand that they are trying mind tricks on you. Toxic people hate and are frightened of people with strong consciousness and self-esteem. Second, by calling them out, you would possibly be the first one that has ever stood up to them. The shock of being discovered plus the shame that comes with it is often a strong enough deterrent. If this is often the case, it will force them to understand the extent of their behavior. Assuming they are not chronic manipulators, they will change their ways.


11. Attack their Center of Gravity


You should not confuse this suggestion with how to make you a manipulator. I suggest that you don't use this method until you are very specific that somebody is manipulating you. Failure to do so might turn you into a mistaken manipulator if you set about attacking an innocent person. Let me take you back a bit so you can know how to use this method accurately. An individual might manipulate you if they believe they have something you lack. An employee might control their boss because they have an “irreplaceable” skill. Your friend may additionally manipulate you because they have more money than you do.


The advantage that these people feel they have over others is what we are about as their center of gravity. If these didn't exist, the manipulator would not have any leverage over others. So, you would like to seek out what makes them feel more powerful than you. Let’s assume your friend intimidates you because they have more money. What you will do is to make your own and leave them alone. Similarly, a boss can find someone with the same skill, or better, than the manipulator and fire them. Once the middle of gravity is made powerless, it creates a balance, and no manipulation can happen.


12. Avoid Emotional Attachments


This approach is as easy to say than do, especially if you discover out too late that you are manipulated. It might even be hard to use if the manipulator is good at hiding their true colors initially. All the same, we must learn to detach our emotional connections with people that we feel are draining us. Well, there are red flags when a manipulator is close to entrapping you. One is that they are going to force premature feelings. For example, an individual you just met two days ago should sound suspicious if they begin saying how you'd 

make a perfect couple. It might be suicidal to swallow this bait and initiate an emotional attachment. Therefore, take longer before allowing new people to trap you with emotions.


In case you are already attached to a toxic person, you ought to work towards eliminating the bond. Realizing that somebody has been using you ought to be disappointing enough to melt the connection. Whenever your mind or heart attempts to welcome them back, remember what they have been doing to you. With time, you would have conditioned your mind to kick the emotional connection away. If you want to maintain the conversation, keep it civil, and move aside whenever they struggle to establish anything more than that. Emotional connections are the manipulator’s favorite tools. Destroy them!


13. Quit Harmful Relationships


Manipulators are often the people we are closest to, like family, spouses, friends, siblings, teachers, etc. This fact is usually sure to be scary, but it is the raw truth. Immediately you realize that anyone close to you is trying or has already manipulated you, you should cut the connection off. Many of us are afraid to quit due to their ties with them, but if you are conscious of the harm that manipulation can cause, you will not hesitate. If a girlfriend needs money or gifts reciprocally for love or sex, you should allow them to go. If a parent belittles you by comparing you to other people, you can rent a place to give them space and maintain respect.


Quitting should not be the immediate response, but, since manipulation is often a deep-rooted problem, trying to unravel the difficulty might worsen it. However, you can try talking to the close person about the behavior and ask them to improve it. If this fails, you have all the reasons to go away. Close relationships got to be 

supportive and not destructive. We need people that balance and nurture our emotions against destroying them. Regardless of how close you are to someone, you have to protect yourself if they are destructive. Anyone, irrespective of how close, should get replaced if they prove to be toxic.


14. React: Do Not Adapt


The worst form of injustice that you simply can do to yourself is to adapt to being manipulated. A manipulative boss wants you to report back to work daily at 8 am and work for peanuts while breaking the banks. Your toxic boyfriend wants you to run home after school so you can cook for them and make them feel like kings as they lazy on the sofa and sip on whiskey. Adapting to manipulation will weaken you further and awaken more demands in the toxic person. It is the surest way to remain locked in a box and controlled for eternity. At some point, renew the boundary and stand up for yourself.


When you react, it breaks the monotony of always following blind instructions. Instead of convincing your mind and body that you can put up with the abuse, find ways to change it. We have heard stories of wives who are beaten close to death, but they put up with the abuse because they love their husbands or want the children to grow with both parents present. The best reaction in situations like these would be talking to professionals like counselors to move forward without the abuser. Action should be taken as early as possible before the mind adapts to manipulation due to control and repetition. People only treat us as we allow them to.


15. Possess A Good Sense of Purpose


A person who is driven by destiny is harder to regulate and fool. One 

reason blamed for manipulators' high success rates is that a lot of us lack a sense of purpose. Even once we do, it tends to be insufficient. Someone who has no destiny and direction can do anything and believe things easily since they need no specific goals and plans. If a manipulator ever comes into contact with such an individual, swaying them will be a walk in the park. Once you lack a sense of purpose, you have no idea why you live or where your life is heading. To the manipulator, you are an empty vessel that they will fill with their malice.


So, to keep manipulation and control away, you need to have a clear path in life, which results in a specific goal. With this easy plan, you become harder to distract. One way to tell if you lack a sense of purpose is to gauge how much time you spend on reality TV, celebrity gossip, parties, uncontrolled hangouts, and other not-so-beneficial activities. If you spend a lot of your time on such, then it means your life has a void which you are trying to fill with these activities. Therefore, you are likely to embrace a manipulator once they approach you with “plans,” not knowing they will be using you while destroying your life. Once you are sure about your destination and the road to get there, nobody can misguide or distract you.


16. Stop Being a Cry Baby


I am obliged to mention that if somebody manipulates you once, shame on them! However, if they manipulate you time and time again, then it means you are an idiot. An idiot is someone who lets others walk all over them. An idiot is someone comfortable with being a punching bag or scapegoat for others. Once you become an individual who is usually crying for getting used and always blaming others for your mistakes, it becomes a humiliation. The instant you realize that somebody is up to some fishy business with your life, 

take hold immediately and don't wait to get hurt so you will start crying. Only a few people around you care about what you are feeling, so it is up to you to take the bull by the horns and direct your life.


For the millionth time, people will only manipulate you if you permit them. As an adult, you are liable for both your failures and successes. If people easily outsmart you, then the fault is yours. You see, we all agree that negative people exist, right? Who does one think will protect you if you do not put in any effort of your own? As humans, we need to learn from our mistakes. What I mean is, if you have been manipulated before, don't allow it to happen again. Anyone who causes your instincts to shiver or makes you question your reality is poisonous. Move fast and delete them from your life. Cut them loose and forget they existed. Crybabies are seen as irresponsible people that love whining rather than taking charge. Don't be one!


17. Learn to say No


You do not need to accept as right everything that is thrown at you. Remember that creating independent decisions is one of your fundamental rights. Your “no” doesn't need to be rude but diplomatic. By being diplomatic, I mean saying it and meaning it. People are keen on convincing others when they have already been told no. You need to make people understand that it is final and not up for debate when deciding. This fact is what we mean by setting yourself as a priority and commanding the respect that you deserve.


It is essential that once you say no, it shouldn't cause you to feel guilty. Sensible people understand that when an individual rejects something, it is not a personal reaction but a mere expression of freedom. Manipulators are stubborn people that do not like getting 

left. When handling them, make them know that you have made your decision and will not change your mind at all costs. If they persist, you would possibly get to apply a different technique intrinsically, our final method of avoiding manipulation: setting consequences.


18. Setting Consequences


Finally, you would possibly have tried many of those methods to get rid of a toxic person, but they continue to be persistent. It is a common occurrence when handling disoriented people like psychopaths and narcissists who are notorious manipulators. When it gets to the present point, you would like to deploy consequences. Deploying a result in this context means you may be forced to use a harsher approach to deal with the menace since all diplomatic methods have proved futile.


Setting consequences can involve soft or tough actions. Gentle actions include cutting the person off completely, quitting a relationship, stopping some benefits that the person was earning from you, or the other activity that adds up to termination of the prevailing relationship. Divorce may be an exemplar of setting a consequence. Severe consequences should be the last resort, but never hesitate to use them if need be. The most apparent tough significance is seeking external assistance, like reporting the person to the authorities. Once you feel that your life or well-being is under any sort of threat from someone, trust your guts, and seek help as soon as possible. Setting consequences are meant to end the manipulation and compel the violator to restore the necessary respect.


You need always to remember that toxic people pick on the subject feel are weak. As long because the subject remains compliant and passive, the manipulators move in and interfere with their lives. 

Toxic people, on their part, are weeping cowards on the inside. They are people seeking to validate their weaknesses by putting others down. However, once we stand up to them, they often back down. This way often is why you need to understand their techniques and thwart them at their earliest manifestation. Failure to prevent manipulation may cause you to rise one morning and wonder who or what ruined your life. You have got 18 suggestions from this book to defend yourself from being manipulated. Use them.

Dark Psychology and How to Analyze People


How to Analyze and Influence People Through the Reading of Body Language and the Technique's Secrets of Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP)


by


Shirley Reason









Introduction


I want to thank and congratulate you for downloading this book, “
Dark Psychology and How to Analyze People

.”


If you would like to know what an individual feels just by watching her face, maybe it is time to learn a little more about body reading, which is nothing more to understand that gestures and positions have a lot to say- far more than you can imagine.


To give you an idea, 55% of the knowledge an individual relays when communicating comes from body language. This body reading thing is so curious that it is interesting to highlight some of the various kinds of research already done addressing the theme:


For instance, did you know that psychopaths can detect vulnerability only by analyzing the way an individual walks?


Another study suggests that it is possible to know if a politician cares about a specific subject solely based on his hands. Possible?


The Importance of Analyzing People


Your ability to analyze people might determine whether you will succeed or fail. Humans are social animals. We nearly always need the input of other people to achieve our essential life goals. But what happens if we take on people that are unfit for his or her roles? We suffer defeat. Thus, it is of utmost importance to be able to analyze people. The following are some advantages of studying people:


It helps you recognize your allies


Whether you wish it or not, the whole world won't take a liking to you. Some people are going to be for you, and people are going to be against you. To maximize your chances of success, you want to work 

with people like you while ignoring those who dislike you. Your ability to research people will assist you to single out those that are in favor of you. Considering that people are often pretty complicated, your ability to know their real persona cannot be overstated. For example, if you are pursuing a career that involves serving the general public, you will end up being surrounded by all kinds of people. Clearly, not all of these people wish you well.


Nevertheless, in the same breath, not all of them are against you. In such a situation, you have to exercise a lot of care, lest you end up working with your enemy, who will eventually bring you down. If you tell your secrets to the enemy, he will run out there and spill it all. If you get close enough to the enemy, he might sow bad thoughts into your mind, making you take the wrong direction. All of those are often avoided by sharpening your ability to differentiate good people from bad people. Of course, this is usually not a skill you can develop overnight. You have to repeatedly practice until you are good at spotting the fake ones.


It helps avoid conflict


In most cases, conflict arises due to a disparity in expectations. In a relationship, if the person expects one thing from his mate, and his wish is not met, it can cause him grief. Likewise, the other way around.


These are the type of scenarios that cause conflict in a relationship. If the person had taken the time to know what their partner is basically like, they might not be shocked at a later time when their partner behaved in a particular way. Thus, it is essential to know the person with who you are stepping into a relationship, for this may minimize your fights. Analyzing an individual helps you understand their triggers. You get a chance to decide whether or not you would 

like to involve yourself with them. If you are looking for a life partner, there are some things that you cannot compromise on, and then you want to analyze potential candidates to seek out whether or not they possess these characteristics. If you ignore this step, you are in danger of getting into a tumultuous marriage.


Understanding what other people's personalities are like is educating yourself on acting or not acting in front of those people. When you learn that somebody isn't into corny jokes, you can stop yourself from working trivially, and in the same breath, when you realize that somebody has an enjoyable attitude, you will try not to be a bore.


It allows you to understand the diversity


Human beings are incredibly diverse. And this is often a good thing. You can't understand this diversity until you concentrate on people. Someone who comes from Asia might exhibit certain personality traits that differ from the typical American. This way is often not an opportunity to bash the Asian for being different from you, but rather, it is a chance to understand the individuality of the Asian.


People that bash others for being different from them are simply narrow-minded. Analyzing people gives you the ability to acknowledge and accept our differences. It causes you to be a more cultured person. If you visit other parts of the world, you can easily fit in because you have a mindset of adjusting. On the other hand, someone who is against the popularity and appreciation of diversity will find himself hostile with people that are unlike him.


It helps you fine-tune your goals


We don't sleep in a vacuum. The actions, words, and behaviors of people will affect us. Everyone has an idol that they look up to. Your icon is the person with who you'd want to trade lives. Aside from supplying you with hope, your model gives you a chance to review 

the various qualities you can get in their line of labor. For example, if you want to become a journalist, you have to know that it is not about having language skills. Still, you have to improve your personality so that more people won't only be comfortable around you, but enough to open up and let you lose their secrets. When you combat the practice of keenly observing people, you are in a position to work out which career path suits your qualities.


It helps you understand the motivations of individuals


There is a motive behind every action, but these motives are not always obvious. Some people will instantly reveal who they are, but some will attempt to downplay their actual image. But if you are a reasonable observer, you can always tell what is happening. By taking some time to research people, you are in a far better position to know their goals.


Having this data helps you make self-preserving decisions. Manipulative people are known for acting or speaking in a way that won’t betray their manipulative agenda. Unless you are extra careful in your analysis of their persona, you would possibly miss their motive and become another one of their victims.


It helps you understand an individual's strengths


Every person has both weaknesses and strengths. The reason why a number of us become successful is that we maximize our strengths. Failure to maximize our muscles can make us feel disillusioned about life. The skill of identifying our strengths is vital in recognizing other people's strengths. Thus, once you are trying to find someone to work with, you will be able to spot their strengths and weaknesses, making your team of top quality.


It helps in predicting behavior


Your ability to research personalities is significant in predicting how various people will act under different circumstances. Life isn't one smooth ride. There are many challenges encountered on the road. Additionally, for the most part, success depends on how we handle challenges. Having the ability to research various personalities empowers you to know how people will react to challenges. For example, if you notice that somebody has violent personality markings or has anger issues, you would want to skip on the person because their violent nature will soon become apparent.


Men and ladies use different body languages at the time of seduction. Women start smiling, raising their eyebrows, lowering their eyelids quickly, then stare. Next, almost without exception, they place their hands on the brink of their mouths and smile or lick their lips.


On the other hand, men inflate the chest, jut their chin, arch their backs, make gestures with their hands and arms, and make movements that will demonstrate confidence and signalize their power.


The fact is that if you would like to analyze people and read the body language, you would like to avoid falling into some common traps; after all, crossed arms don't always mean a lack of interest. Here are a couple of common mistakes made by people trying to measure how others communicate by gesture:


All of these subjects are what we will be exploring in detail throughout this guide. So stay tuned.


Let’s get started!









The Structure of Dark Psychology


In all realms of science, a framework is a structured approach consisting of separate sectors that support a theoretical study or research. There is a theoretical framework in the broad range of popular psychology composed of 5 points and a psychological framework used in general psychiatric practice. Both of those things are applied to Dark Psychology.


The theoretical framework is altered little or no in dark psychiatric works, while the psychological framework varies about the type of labor being performed (treatment or study). The theoretical framework consists of Structure, Function, Behavior, Cognitive Ability, and Psychoanalysis.


_
      


Structuralism

- This entity of the psychological theoretical framework is implemented every time. The goal is to spot the precise points of the patient’s psychological experiences using a technique called introspection. Then Introspection was developed by psychologist Wilhelm Wundt and relied on the patient’s reflection of their internal emotions and thoughts. These thoughts and feelings are then processed into the most basic kind of consciousness.


_
      


Functionalism

- Functionalism was introduced shortly after Wundt’s student, Edward B. Titchener, formally released structuralism to the psychological community. Intellectuals and brilliants minds like Darwin inspired functionalism. Functionalism took structuralism and pushed out the thought that focused on the element of a person’s consciousness and, instead, focused on the 

individual patient and what differences were accounted for.


_
      


Behaviorism

- This entity of Psychological frameworks was originally brought forth in 1913 when John B. Watson published “Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It.” Behaviorism is totally and solely based on an individual's outward actions with no focus given on inner thoughts and emotions. Watson fully encapsulated the view of behaviorism when he said: it is believed that all behavior is due to the conditioning and education an individual received from the instant they were born.


_
      


Cognitivism

- Cognitivism was created as a response to the increase of behaviorism. Psychologists argued that thought is more than a behavior. They believe that view is what makes behaviors and cannot be one on its own. This theoretical practice studies the ideas, thoughts, processes, and intellect and not the individual's behavior.


_
      


Psychoanalysis

- Psychoanalysis is perhaps the most widely known framework of traditional psychology. This process involves a bit of every type mentioned above, including the effect of childhood experiences and how they relate to the adult process. There is a stress on the psychological state processes that individuals undergo without even knowing that they are.


General Psychological Framework


While all of the above are used in some theoretical fashion or for others in psychology, the overall framework is more in tune with the precise treatment type the patient will be undergoing. There are four main types:


_
       



Psychotherapy in the humanistic model


_
       

Psychotherapy in the cognitive model


_
       

Psychotherapy in the psychodynamic model


_
       

Psychotherapy in the family model


All four of those you can find in the mainstream psychological community. And however, once you begin to cross over to Dark Psychology, this stuff changes. Therefore, the therapy is a smaller amount, and the research more. Often it will take a specific sector of psychology to dive into the minds of somebody blocked by Dark Psychology. There are no real explanations on why these people tend to be harder to speak to. But those in the .01 percent rarely react to any of the above therapies.


The Dark Continuum


All individuals have the power to tap into their dark psyche, but the bulk does only on a really minuscule level. Then there are those criminals who move down the spectrum further until the end is formed from that .01 percent of heinous and indescribable crimes.


Imagine that the aspects of Dark Psychology sit on a line. People who use actions that fall into the dark spectrum sit on this line. All deviance, malice, manipulative activities, and perverse behaviors sit somewhere in the dark line. The dark line is specific to action and feelings, thoughts, ideas, and points of deem well. This line represents all dark psyches in the realm of this sector of dark psychology.


In comparison, you can also picture a Venn diagram where the three circles overlap one another. Within each of the chart are the thoughts, actions, etc. Some overlap with one another, while others stand alone. The circle's outer edges are often interpreted because of the less volatile sectors of Dark Psychology, while those intersecting 

inner circles include, up to, the .01 percent.


While the acts and thoughts in a dark psyche fall under the diagram or line counting on their severity, the Continuum isn't meant to be a tool used to decide the actual seriousness of the occurrence. Nuccitelli is currently working further on this idea because it is not complete. Through more research and a more open expansion of studies in Dark Psychology, the Dark Continuum will filter right down to a more precise theory.


The Dark Factor


The Dark Factor, while relatively new in psychology, is not something that has been hidden from psychological practice through the years. Charles Spearman, an English psychologist, in 1904, made two of the most critical discoveries in Psychology so far. The first discovery was based on the thought that there was a general factor of intelligence, the g-factor. This factor defined the speed of scoring for intelligence and founded the very fact that no matter the indicator, as long as the test is thorough and sufficient, you will be able to measure the cognitive intelligence of an individual.


Ultimately, Moshagen and his associates have answered the long-standing question of whether there was one force that unified all dark traits. This fact can be D-Factor. It shows that there is not only one single trait that defines a dark psyche. Instead, there is a mess of human characteristics, some good, some bad, that culminate into the extent of darkness your mind consists. When testing their theory, the team used nine different traits, well established in the psychology realm, and tested people on them. The characteristics used were:


_
       

Spitefulness


_
       



Self-Interest


_
       

Sadism


_
       

Psychopathy


_
       

Psychological Entitlement


_
       

Narcissism


_
       

Moral Disengagement


_
       

Machiavellianism


_
       

Egoism


People from all walks of life were tested, and the results were combined and studied. In the end, the team came up with the following conclusions:


_
      

 It had been found that there was a positive relationship between all of the dark traits tested for.


_
      

 The most relatable D-Factor items fell into patterns that gave a basis for his or her theory. The idea closely attached the concepts of utility maximization, inflicting disutility, and justifying malevolent beliefs.


_
      

 They found that the people having higher D-Factor scores, when given money, were more likely to keep it to themselves. On top of this finding, these people were also more likely to possess unethical behaviors like cheating.


_
      

 The D-Factor was closely associated with self-centeredness, dominance, impulsive behaviors, a requirement for power, aggressive tendencies, and morality issues. Simultaneously, they were also related to sincere actions, fair ideas, avoidance of greed, and modest behavior.


_
      

 The D-Factor does not relate to just one measure. Even when tested repeatedly, removing different variables from the experiment, the correlations were the same.


The Dark Factor tests were far more complex than the above tests. 

Information about the person’s background, case history, temperament, and life experiences were also considered. This test has paved the way for further research into the dark character and has been widely accepted amongst the psychological community. This test should lead the thought of Dark Psychology further into the realm of everyday psychology. One question that is often asked, though, is what is in the middle of the D-Factor. What type of person is the very darkest, the very center of the flower bud?


This idea is called the Dark Singularity.


The Dark Singularity


Before we dive into the very meaning of Dark Singularity in the realm of Dark Psychology, it is essential to notice a few ideas that will help you further understand the depth that humans can reach with the Dark Factor. While on the surface of lifestyle, we tend to consider negative things as having boundaries or borders. Our human brains don't just like the idea of something being much more evil or ominous than we can comprehend. Science has a lot of various ideas that the human brain can't completely wrap itself around.


Singularity In General Terms


In science, a singularity is a point in space and time with infinite value when it involves the infinite density at the small center of a region. In theory, the middle of an area never ends; it is infinite. Therefore, it is theorized that the force of gravity can compress an object, thus far that it almost has zero volume and becomes infinitely dense. For now, the purpose of singularity is that space and time do not exist on the size that the human mind recognizes. Because space and time are entirely different, the laws of physics can't be applied.


The very magnitude of this type of event is nearly impossible for our brains to understand completely. We are surrounded by all of the things that make life possible. Gravity, air, pressure, density beat perfect symbiotic balance with our human bodies or the other way around. To imagine an area in space and time that is so different is often unbelievable and almost frightening; what people don’t realize. On a smaller scale, a theoretical scale that doesn't involve being crushed to infinite density, the singularity is often applied to things in our current day and time.


The Dark Triad


So many people argue that the dark triad people are so seductive. Thus, the most critical question we'd like to ask is why.


The truth is, the Dark triad has three personality traits; narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy. The term Narcissism springs from the Greek myth of Narcissus - a hunter who fell crazy in love with his reflections when swimming in a pool. In other words, narcissists are people that aren't only selfish but also boastful, arrogant, hypersensitive to criticism, and lacks empathy.


Machiavellianism is a word that was coined from the Italian politician and diplomat Machiavelli in the 16th century. This man earned notoriety when his book “The Prince” was interpreted as an endorsement to dark arts – cunning and deceit in diplomacy. Some of the traits related to this personality type include manipulation, duplicity, a scarcity of morality and emotion, and self-interest.


Psychopathy, on the other hand, includes a scarcity of remorse and empathy, being volatile and manipulative or others, and showing antisocial behavior. You want to note that there is a difference between psychopathic qualities and being a psychopath, which lies 

in the commonly held link with criminal violence.


This way indeed is one of the most researched areas in psychology. Simultaneously, this has contributed an excellent deal to the more in-depth understanding of humanity's darker side. How far we differ from one another in the extent to which we frequently exhibit darkness - the darkness in thoughts, emotions, and behaviors in our lifestyle, and the question we fail to ask is what lies on the sunshine side of humanity.


The truth is, socially aversive people exist. But what of everyday saints? Don’t get me wrong – I'm not talking about the person who gives a lot and receives public applauds and awards for their giving with great care that they will gain personal success. I'm talking about one that just by being, they shine their light so bright that it radiates in all directions. The one person who is not strategic about their generosity is the one who emits unconditional love – both spontaneously and naturally – because it is who they really are.


According to the study, three distinct features characterize the sunshine triad; Kantianism, humanism, and faith in humanity. Kantianism simply refers to using people as ends to themselves and not even as mere means. Humanism, on the other hand, is valuing the price and dignity of everyone. Faith in humanity is about believing in the fundamental goodness of humans.


You would like to know that the sunshine and dark triads are not opposites of each other. Yes, they are negatively associated with one another, but the truth is that the connection is merely moderate, which supports the thought that every person has a bit of sunshine and darkness in them. While some score high in the dark triad, it is best not to check them out as lesser beings – in any case, to possess the dark side is to be human. Instead, it is imperative to see them as 

amplified and released adaptations of the potential that exists in them.


According to a research study, a dark triad is related to being younger, male, motivated by power, achievement, affiliation, and instrumental sex. They are the type of people who have upgrade esteems, apparent utilization, youthful safeguard styles, narrow-mindedness, and see inventive work and interminability to kill the fantastic quality. The dim set of three has a negative relationship to such attributes as pleasantness, life fulfillment, sympathy, a relaxed inner self, compassion, scruples, and a definite conviction that people are acceptable.


Let us bring this close to home – think of a representative at your work environment who appears to derive joy from annoying others or, in any event, disrupting the organization. This type of individual does not have a sense of regret. They lie once they are found doing something unsuitable. These are the type of people who are often named the "Dim Triad." When someone shows evil behavior, you will likely see these three traits – narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy.


Let us dig deeper into each of those features. When does one say that somebody is narcissistic, Machiavellianism, or psychopathic?


Well, Narcissism is about having a complete focus on self. It is about believing that you are unique and will follow a particular set of societal rules that others follow. You are also known for your inability to point out empathy. While these sorts of people may show cognitive empathy – compassion only through words – the truth is that empathy lacks in their actions and emotional feelings. When they tell you, “I am sorry ABC happened,” what they mean to say is that they don’t feel any sadness, remorse, or real feelings to show of 

it. They tend to do things with great care to look good and not because they think it is the right thing to do.


Machiavellianism is about someone using exploitation and manipulations of others to take control or to have power over others. The thing with Machiavellian people is that they possess a somewhat negative perception of what morality is. They think that people follow morals because they are not smart enough to work out a way to circumvent them. They are so focused on what is in it for them and the way to con others with great care so they can get the most out of things.


When you consider a psychopath, the first thing that comes to mind is selfishness, impulsive behavior, lack of remorse, and breaking the law. While people can’t seem to decipher social norms, rules, and regulations, a psychopath knows the difference between right and wrong but doesn't seem to worry in the least.


Interestingly, these three dark triad qualities are genetic. Yes, the surrounding plays a big role in developing those personality traits, but the truth is that it is more likely that one inherited them from their genes, making them more predisposed. That said, this does not mean that genetics is destiny. The truth is you can have a genotype for a particular trait, but that does not translate into a phenotype. You can have a gene for blue and brown eyes, but the phenotype is brown eyes.


Additionally, everyone has certain features of Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy at some point in their lives. The great thing is that many people can recognize these behaviors and realize that they do not work well in their professional and private lives.


When you don’t notice that these traits are negatively impacting your life, that they are pervasive, only then can it be ruled as a 

disorder!


It is crucial to notice that these three factors of the Dark Triad produce different workplace outcomes and personal life – counting on how low or high you are in each feature. High Machiavellianism and psychopathy indicate a high chance of low performance at the workplace. Yes, a lack of quality in work performance means you are not achieving a particular baseline, being counterproductive might mean that you simply are overachieving but in the wrong way.


The truth is, you are using hard tactics, a method or the opposite when manipulating others – common among Machiavellians and psychopaths. On the other hand, narcissists tend to use soft tactics to take advantage of others so that they will eventually get what they want. The difference between hard tactics and soft tactics is that tough tactics include threatening others or sabotaging work. On the contrary, soft tactics are about giving compliments and gifts to influence people to provide you with what you want.


Take a step back to your life and think of these three factors of the Dark triad – are you most likely encouraging one or more of those traits without realizing it? Or are you doing them knowingly with great care that you can get what you want?


What can you do to ensure that your dark side doesn't take hold of your light side?









Persuasion and Manipulation


Seeing how individuals structure assessments, contentions, display, and incorporate realities into their psychological models is mission-basic in your capacity to influence anyone to become engaged with an idea and afterward follow through on that thought. That is the embodiment of influence.


_
       

The distinction between influence and manipulation lies in:


_
       

The expectation behind your craving to convince that individual,


_
       

The honesty and simplicity of the procedure, and


_
       

The net advantage or effect on the individual


Control recommends impact with the target to trace, control, or think up the person on the inverse side of the talk into fulfilling something, considering something, or engaging with something that clears them out as either harmed or without advantage.


It might likewise suggest that you are disguising a craving to maneuver them to your perspective, so it'll profit you. What's more, if this advantage were uncovered, that disclosure would make the other individual far less hospitable to your message since it might either:


_
       

Demonstrate a solid inclination towards their absence of advantage in the trade


_
      

 Or demonstrate an ulterior thought process in the endeavor at influence, frequently determined by uneven advantage, or some mixture of both.


So, for example, suppose I was selling someone a vehicle, and I had the entirety of my devices of influence and techniques. That 

individual strolled into my business, and it had been evident, with a gaggle of six children, they were checking out and indeed required a family-sized, reasonable vehicle.


In any case, I used every one of my powerful capacities to influence the parent that he should not purchase a little van but rather a two-seater convertible to relive his childhood. And in doing intrinsically, show his kids that it is so essential to keep according to their energetic standards, realizing beyond any doubt that I might make double the commission on the vehicle. It had been totally unsatisfactory for them.


That is manipulation.


Presently, imagine a scenario where that same parent came into my business with an identical six children and said to me, "Man, I simply got to blow some money. I should buy a six-seater. I do know it is ridiculous and that I truly cannot legitimize this. However, I'm only joining for the two-seater convertible?"


Also, imagine a scenario in which I then used my convincing capacities to gradually and deliberately open up a conversation and many realities that drove this parent to grasp the certifiable advantage of acquiring the more moderate and appropriate family vehicle.


That is influence, not manipulation.


Since I used an identical arrangement of aptitudes to influence someone to do something that I actually believe was to their greatest advantage, instead of persuading them to do something that was certainly not to their most significant benefit – and certainly was in effect not precisely honest with at any rate some part of what I was discussing.


At last, influence methodologies, apparatuses, and a comprehension of how to introduce realities, contentions, and communications such as getting someone on the other side of the discussion to become engaged with your perspective are basically about influence.


The hidden expectation, internet advantage, and veracity with which you breathe life into this carpenter's kit create the contrast between influence and manipulation.


The distinction between influence and manipulation has been a topic of dialogue for truly an enormous number of years. In old Greece, in the fourth century BC, the father of influence, Aristotle, restricted educators' gathering referred to as the Sophists. The Sophists gave guidance in several controls yet got notorious for his or her educating of talk. Aristotle conflicted with the Sophists because they couldn't have cared less about truth; however, they would advance any thought for an expense. Aristotle stated that the Sophists were participating in manipulation since they purposefully misdirected individuals and caused hurt.


Why Persuasion Is Good


To precisely perceive the excellence between influence and manipulation, it is fundamental to grasp the undergird influence's morals. Some correspondence scholars have proclaimed that the effect is "morally impartial.” In other words, that influence is neither acceptable nor terrible, however merely a fair-minded procedure. I do not acknowledge this position. I might fight that the Aristotelian perspective that result isn't nonpartisan, however honorable, is right. Influence is intrinsically acceptable in light of the very fact that it is one of the essential methods through which truth gets known. An idea is advanced with proof through an effective strategy, and a person is permitted to either acknowledge or dismiss that 

powerful intrigue openly. Influence does, without a doubt, include moving individuals to an edge, they do not immediately hold; however, not by asking or persuading. Preferably, it contains cautious planning, the best possible encircling of contentions, the introduction of distinctive supporting proof, and the push to locate the right passionate match with your crowd.


The way sees the conviction that influence may be a fair and powerful method for landing at the truth that it is the reason for present-day financial aspects, directing practices, and the lawful framework. What's more, influence is additionally the establishment of a democratic government. Most rules systems use attentive moral power when they choose pioneers, found outlaws, or plan to ensure their residents. Indeed, even the individuals who become alarmed with the thought of influence cannot escape from it. The result is imbued inside human correspondence. When imparting, individuals both deliberately and unexpectedly advance certain convictions and practices. Thus, influence doesn't involve decisions; it is innate in social connection. Indeed, it is so inescapable in human correspondence that, once in a while, it seems to be practically undetectable. The supposed individuals' callings – legislative issues, law, welfare work, advising, business the board, promoting, deals, advertising, the service – should be called influence callings.


At its center, influence is the quest for truth. It is through the power that positive change happens. For example, clear messages are logically demonstrated to incite lyceum understudies to abstain from smoking, increasing lifesaving blood gifts, and keep youth from joining packs. Influence helps manufacture harmonious understandings between countries. Influence assists open with increasing shut social orders. Influence is pivotal to the gathering pledges endeavors of a worthy cause and generous associations. 

Power persuades drivers to lock in when driving or forgo driving when they have had a few alcohol bottles. Influence is used to influence a drunkard or medication subordinate relative to look for proficient assistance. The effect is how a dark horse group's mentor moves the players to offer it their everything. Influence is an apparatus used by guardians to ask kids not to take rides from outsiders or to allow anybody to contact them such that feels awkward. So, influence is the foundation of various positive, prosocial attempts. Next to all of the decency that we discover on the earth might be practiced without power.


However, the integrity of influence and the way it is implanted inside human instinct isn't what causes individuals' concerns. What causes nervousness is the debasement of force. Undoubtedly, when influence is mutilated, it can get manipulative, which is perilous. Through manipulation, scalawags, religion pioneers, and tyrants have mishandled, oppressed, and even slaughtered millions. In any case, as unfavorable as manipulation could also be, it needs never to be mistaken for influence. Manipulation is the corruption of power. It is not worried about truth but instead double-dealing. Aristotle remarked on this in his acclaimed work, Rhetoric, when he accentuated, " maltreatment of the explanatory workforce can work extraordinary evil. An identical charge is often brought against every beneficial thing spare righteousness itself, particularly against the foremost helpful things, such as quality, well-being, riches, and military aptitude.


Properly utilized, they work the best gift; and wrongly used, they do the best damage.


How to Tell If a Message is Manipulative


Therefore, the proper inquiry is how you would possibly recognize 

influence and manipulation? Next are the three precise yet dependable ways in which you can tell if a message is manipulative.


_
       


Intention




The aim is an essential factor in deciding whether a solicitation is manipulative. If the individual endeavors to exhibit an idea or conduct that may not be to the best advantage of another, they are participating in manipulation. Unfortunately, this is often very normal. Individuals habitually fall under the snare of maltreating others to go after what they want. One of the underlying drivers of this Machiavellian point of view is not seeing others with equity. The famous scholar Kant expounded on this attitude when he recommended that the central statute of ethical quality is regarding a person as an individual and not as a thing.


_
       


Withholding Truth




Manipulation includes misshaping or retaining truth. Regularly, this is often seen through overstating the upsides of conduct, thought, or item. It had been this type of manipulation that incited the expression Caveat Emptor, which is Latin for "Purchaser Beware," to get predominant. The expression was incredibly far-reaching in those chronicled periods when there was little responsibility for vendors. The maxim was an admonition to potential purchasers to be suspicious of those selling merchandise and making sure that they confirmed before purchasing that the nature of the item was indistinguishable from the cases made by the dealer. Even today, many of us have encountered being told about the highlights or advantages of an object or administration. Afterward, in the wake of obtaining it, they understood that they had been misdirected. This fact is not right, as something besides genuine portrayal is conspicuous manipulation.


_
       


Coercion




The pressure is the third and most clear segment of a manipulative intrigue. The expulsion of free decision, the ultimate proposal – do it, or something bad might happen. Interestingly, influence includes impact, however, never power. A characterizing normal for effect is a free decision. The individual must be fit for tolerating or dismissing the position that has been encouraged by the person in question. Along these lines, a greeting that one can't state no to isn't powerful yet is coercive and as needs are manipulative. There is an enormous contrast between influence and manipulation. Impact propels things of all included. It is a prosocial try that aides the recipient of a message in tolerating truth.


Interestingly, a manipulative intrigue is one that, whenever embraced, will adversely affect another. Manipulation is ethically off base and, eventually, counterproductive to the interests of all included. The deliberate utilization of misdirecting impact strategies eventually turns into a mentally and monetarily self-harming process. In this manner, through a particular and powerful comprehension of both the rightness of influence and the three essential components of manipulation, you can be better able to convince others morally and shield yourself from manipulative solicitations.


Recognizing a Manipulator and Persuader


When you read through this guidebook, it will be tempting to assume that dark manipulation is simply a theory, something that sounds good in the movies. Nothing that we will encounter during our lifetime as long as we will stay away from some cults and things that say a bit fishy. But if manipulation were that easy to remain far away from, then nobody would even bother trying to be manipulative because they wouldn’t be able to find the victims they need.


With that said, there are a lot of various times when we will be able to find the facility of dark manipulation all around us. Many big groups we are used to working with and people we are close to are going to use dark manipulation to assist them in getting what they want, no matter how it will affect others.


We will check out some various groups who will use dark manipulation to get what they want. We will glance at how individuals, businesses, the government, and terrorist organizations, to mention a few, will be able to use many of the techniques that we have said to assist them in getting what they need out of their victims.


Individuals Using Dark Manipulation


We have spent most of our time specializing in the idea of manipulation and the way a person can use it against others. There are many times when you can use some of the ideas that accompany dark manipulation to assist you in getting ahead and obtaining what you want.


It is important to distinguish here that different types of manipulation can happen. Most of us are going to use some manipulation at some point in our lives. We may use the reference that we convince someone to help us get a job. We may use people to assist us in getting further ahead. But often, once we do this manipulation, we do it so that it doesn’t harm the other person, and sometimes, they will also benefit.


However, when it involves the dark manipulation that we have been talking about in this guidebook, there is a more sinister approach. We aren't getting to worry about the other person in the least. We would like to get to whatever our goals are as quickly as possible, 

and if somebody else gets harmed in the process, then that is fine.


And this often is how we tell the difference between a bit of manipulation and dark manipulation. We will see that one strives not to cause harm to anyone else. And the other does not care in the least if somebody else ends up getting harmed in the process. And this is often a part of what makes it so dangerous. We only worry about how we can benefit, and no care is given to the other person.


There are many times when this is going to happen in our daily lives. Maybe there is someone who wants to get a promotion at work. They will say a lot of bad things against you, worried that you may also be a contender for the position. They will tell the boss a lot of bad things about you, try to get you to do the work for them to take credit, and even belittle you in front of others and on your own, so you feel that you aren't qualified for the position.


Another place where manipulation shows up regularly is in your relationships. There are many times a manipulator, especially if they are a narcissist, will undertake and use these techniques.


When this manipulation starts in a relationship, everything tends to look good. The two will act as the partners are in love, and the victim goes to fell head over heels in love with the other person. This fact might feel like a honeymoon phase, and the victim can’t imagine anything that would ever be better for them. But, this is often all done intentionally. The manipulator doesn’t care about or feel any of it. But they know that this part is important to keep the victim hooked, so they play along.


Over time, the mood will change. There will be many guilt trips, moving of the goalposts, belittling, yelling and intimidating, and more. The manipulator starts doing this in the hopes of getting the victim to do what they want, without the victim knowing why they 

are doing it. This way is often going to include periods of silent treatments. The manipulator will always blame the victim even when the manipulator technically was the one in the wrong.


There will be enough chances to get back to the love and affection stage to keep the victim right where they are, which is why they stay for long. The manipulator will get the attention they need, alongside maybe some prestige and more, then they struggle to keep the victim there as long as possible. On the other hand, the victim is getting nothing but hurt feelings, pain, and different negative feelings in the process.


This fact is one example of how individuals can use manipulation to get what they want. This manipulation is a strong tool that can be used, especially when the manipulator is close to whom you feel you can trust. Since the method is usually done at a slow pace and over time, it is almost impossible for the victim to understand what is happening before they are too deep.


Businesses Using Dark Manipulation


We can also look towards businesses and see how they will use some tactics that accompany dark manipulation to get what they need. Their end goal goes to be to get as many consumers to get the merchandise as possible. This way helps them extend their bottom lines and have the maximum amount of money in the bank.


Now, most businesses will do their best to supply a good product, one that will benefit the customer in so many ways. Whether it's a good pair of shoes, some good food, and more, they will confirm that some value is present, which will entice the customer and keep them coming for more.


Of course, most companies are not going to go through things and 

try to harm their customers. They need to be able to get repeat customers. And though some products might not lend themselves the best to repeat customers, they at least want to be able to get that first customer to talk about the business to their friends and relations, hopefully getting more people through the door. But they are going to make sure that this happens by providing the customer with a high-quality product.


This type of manipulation and trying to get people through the door isn't a bad thing. If nobody showed up, then the business wouldn't be able to make any money. And most people understand and recognize that there is some sort of manipulation that is happening when we watch a billboard on TV or see another marketing from the company.


But with these, we are allowed to settle on what we would like to do with the merchandise, and if we would like to go out and buy it or not, we are in control. Sure, a number of these advertisements will be compelling and can make it hard to say no, even if you cannot do it.


But we still get the prospect to decide what course of action we would like to go with.


With that said, some businesses want to use dark manipulation tactics to get others to decide to get their products. They don’t care about what proportion value they will provide to the purchasers in the least. They need to make sure that they will sell as many of the products as they can. These companies may do several things to make this happen, including:


_
       

They will make a product that is defective and doesn’t work.


_
      

 They will make the merchandise with something which 

will harm their customers in another way.


_
       

They will tell us unethical marketing options.


_
       

They will lie when it involves the things they say in marketing.


_
      

 They will not follow some of the principles that are outlined in their country of origin to keep the purchasers safe and make sure that there is some fair competition that goes on there.


These practices are sometimes hard to find. We are so willing to concentrate on all or any of the advertisements that we see, and sometimes, we would like to be able to get something that is quick and may make our lives easier. We don’t have the time needed to leap in and do all of the required research along the way. And when this happens, we are more likely to fall for a few of the dark manipulation techniques we hear about above.


Governments Using Dark Manipulation


Another topic that we'd like to consider is whether or not our government is manipulating us. Many of us feel we should always be safe from our government that we are supposed to trust in this body and hope that they have the best interests of the people or the majority of the people at heart. This fact is often a pleasant theory, but it is closer to reality when we assume our government uses dark manipulation against us.


The idea that the government has been able to influence people online has been something that we have known for a few years, and it is easy to see if you know where you are looking. For instance, back in 2011, it had been shown that the US Air Force was already doing this. Most people didn’t even get an opportunity to ascertain these stories, and people who did mention them were thought to be crazy, 

just because the news wasn't public.


No one else proved this information than Edward Snowden. Due to all the publicity that every knowledge on Snowden received, it might have appeared to be something that we might all hear about. Still, it had been another thing that the government could hide from us because the media agreed not to cover it.


Then, what are some of the other ways in which the government is trying to control us to act and react to things in a certain way? Let’s take a glance at some of the various ways we can do this.


Weapons of the Manipulator


_
      

 A profitable controller must have methods that can make them beneficial at using people to locate a good pace last objective. While there are two or three speculations on what makes a practical controller, we will investigate the three necessities that have been set up by George K. Simon, an efficient psychology producer. As demonstrated by Simon, the controller should:


_
       

Be prepared to hide their effective practices and needs from the subject.


_
      

 Be prepared to select the vulnerabilities of their typical subject or, on the other hand, abused people, to comprehend which techniques will be the best in appearing at their destinations.


_
      

 Have some degree of mercilessness rapidly accessible so that they won't need to manage any doubts that may arise because of injuring the subject if it wraps up that way. This damage is often either physical or excited.


The controllers fundamental must achieve all at once to sufficiently control their subjects is to hide their effective practices and targets. 

If the controller evades telling everyone their game-plans or dependably acts intend to people, nobody will remain adequately long to be controlled. Or on the other hand, maybe, the controller needs to choose to hide their musings from others and act like everything is normal. Consistently, the people that are being controlled won't get it, at any rate for no situation. The controller will be sweet, act like their closest companion, and potentially help them with trips on some issue or another. When the subject ponders the situation, the controller has enough information to oblige the matter to progress forward.


Next, the controller should limit comprehending what the vulnerabilities of their organized awful misfortune or abused people are. This fact will assist them in making sense of which methods should appear at the overall objective. Some of the time, the controller may choose to do this development through a bit of recognition. On different occasions, they will have a kind of relationship with the subject before thinking of the complete arrangement.


The third need is that the controller should be barbarous. It won't end up positively if the controller places in the aggregate of their work and, by then, stresses how the subject will eventually reason. If they considered the matter, it is not likely that they might continue with this strategy in any capacity whatsoever. The controller won't believe the subject in the least and doesn't generally mind if any physical or lively damage happens to the matter as long as the general objective is met.


One clarification that controllers are so convincing is that the subject, as often as conceivable, doesn't grasp they are being controlled until another time simultaneously. They may feel that everything is going well; maybe they envision that they have made 

another accomplice in the controller. The controller will choose to use many strategies, including vivacious shakedown, to get their direction eventually.


Step by Step Directions to Regulate Victims


Something that the controller should have the choice to achieve to see achievement is to regulate their subjects.


There are two or three specific speculations available to assist in clarifying how the controller will choose. Two of the hypotheses which will undoubtedly be weakened immediately are those began by Harriet Braiker and Simon.


Harriet Braiker is a clinical pro who has made a private development manager. In her book, she has depicted five fundamental ways in which the controller can control their subjects. These include:


_
       

Rousing information


_
       

Negative help


_
       

Halfway or uncontrollable help


_
       

Discipline


_
       

Horrendous finding that, as they say, gives one fundamental


The hidden two strategies that are talked about fuse moving info and negative help. In motivating analysis, the controller will use a set of procedures, for instance, free affirmation, outward appearances (like a smile or a constrained chuckle), consideration, favors, support, money, over the top saying 'sorry' shallow compassion which can consolidate fake tears, superficial interest, and honor. The reason for using this type of post is to offer personal inspiration to want to be your companion. If you give someone a present or some money, they will be considerably progressively prepared to help you out 

when the need arises. If you can cause the subject to feel perplexed about you, by then, they are going to want to be your accomplice later. The other kind of stronghold which will be used is negative help. At this time, the controller will remove the subject from an adverse condition to accomplish something different.


An example of this would be, "You won't need to finish your work if you engage me to do this for you.” Each of these has expressed the qualities and shortcomings that enable the controller to get what they want. Typically, the controller will use a mixture of various frameworks to get the thing that they want.


Fragmentary or sporadic help can, in like way, be used by a controller. This type of assistance is used enough to make a condition of helplessness and dread in the subject. An example of this comes in betting. While the scholar may win from time to time, they are up to that point, losing a lot of cash when unsure, mainly if they play for a long time. Notwithstanding, the winning is routinely enough to keep the subject continuing similarly, long after they are not set up to do along these lines. The controller will use this framework to render the subject at enough interims to hold the issue is returning.


Repelling is another procedure that is used to control the subject of the controller. Numerous exercises will fit into this class. They enjoy playing the issue, crying, sulking, using the sorry fit, energetic coercion, swearing, dangers, and threatening, using the silent treatment, hollering, and troubling. The reason for using this strategy is to cause the subject to feel they have achieved something inaccurately. The topic will feel horrendous and wish to make things right, falling right back in with the controller.


Finally, the last system that Braiker referred to in her work is the 

horrendous one starter learning. This way is often the point the controller will detonate for the most modest things with embellishment expectations or setting up the subject into not wanting to disavow, go facing, or upset the controller. Some of the procedures that may be used immediately are dangerous shock, unpleasant assault, and other frightening conduct and set up transcendence and quality over the subject.


In like way, Simon has thought of a once-over of strategies that controllers must use to control their horrendous difficulties feasibly. A fraction of these appears like those recorded by Braiker yet with two or three additional subtleties. These would include:


_
      


Lying

: controllers are mind-blowing at misleading their subjects. As often as might be expected under the circumstances, the matter will find that it is difficult to provoke once they are being bewildered by then. When the subject sees a few solutions concerning the conspicuous misrepresentation, it is generally past where it is conceivable to do what should be done. The elemental way that the subject can make sure that they are reducing their odds of being misdirected is paying extraordinary minds to different character types that are aces in the claim to fame of conning, what's more, lying. The controller will lie about anything to get their way, and usually, their subjects won't have any idea that it is happening until it is past where it is conceivable to end it.


_
      


Oversight lying

: this one takes after the system is recorded above with a few slight differentiations. Prohibition lying is somewhat progressively unobtrusive, considering that the controller will confess all with some yet will hold specific vital issues that need to be 

uncovered. Once in a while, this might be called the introduction. The controller may say that they need money to get gas or purchase staple products when honesty; they need the cash to get several prescriptions or other unlawful substances. While they used the money to shop for gas, much proportionate to the communication, they neglected an essential part. The subject quite likely wouldn't have given the money if they knew the true story, and now they could be up to something unlawful.


_
      


Forswearing

: controllers are experts at refusal. None of them will yield that they have done something erroneously, on any occasion, when a large portion of the proof is pointing towards them. They will dependably preclude everything and far from claiming the time cause the subject to look, by all accounts, to be the one at fault.


_
      


Legitimization

: This is often the place the controller will believe a resistance that makes them look mind-boggling. They ill state they did the show since they were trying to help the subject. This framework is, additionally, identified with the methodology for turning.


_
      


Minimization

: This is often a mixture of legitimization and refusal strategies. The controller will tell everyone that their idea is not as dishonest or dangerous as the subject idea. A case of this can be hen the controller says that an assault or insult they performed was only a joke that the subject ought not to consider.


_
      


Specific consideration or mindlessness

: In this framework, the controller tries to avoid offering savvy concerning whatever will divert them from their last 

objective. They ill trivialize it and cause it to show up not irrationally fundamental to them, which it truly isn't. An example of this is when the controller says, "I would lean forward not to hear it."


_
      


Distraction

: controllers aren't just unprecedented at deluding their subjects; they are also specialists at staying far away from contributing straight reactions to questions that are given to them. If someone asks them a solicitation that they couldn't think about or need to know inside and out if they are misleading them, the controller will try to push the conversation in a different direction. Routinely the controller will quickly offer an ill-defined reaction to the solicitation before moving the conversation to another point.


The Weapons Persuader Use


Persuasion is used to convince an individual about something they might not have considered before. Advertisements are one of the ways persuasion techniques are employed. The same methods used to sell the right item are often used to manipulate an individual. There are other ways an individual can persuade you; These include:


_
      


Appealing to authority

 – if you are trying to influence an individual into doing something, using important people or experts to pass your point is extremely convincing. When you reliably research, you can make your argument very convincing and sway your audience. For instance, an individual can say:


For example - the previous first lady Michele Obama has said the only way to get rid of obesity among children is by avoiding junk food from vending machines.


Example – According to a recent study, watching TV reduces stress, causing a reduction in the risk of heart diseases.


Whether true and falsified, both these statements can convince an individual that what is being said is true because an individual has appealed to authority. Dark persuasion can also appeal to authority to persuade their victims to do as they want them to.


_
      


Appeal to reason

 – people are easily convinced when an individual uses logic to influence them. For example, an individual would say:


A bar of chocolate contains 300 calories and 20 grams of sugar. That is not so bad! You can still enjoy your bar of chocolate a day because it is within your caloric limit.


Although that statement is not entirely true, an individual who wants you to push their sales, yet they know it is not healthy, will use it to influence you. People tend to trust where figures believe the knowledge to be authentic. This tactic is widely used to manipulate individuals to do as other wishes.


Empathize or appeal to emotion – making an individual feel sad, angry, or happy can persuade them. For example:


A person may tell you that your donation is vital because it will feed a hungry child for each day, or if you do not donate, a toddler will go hungry and die, and you will be a part of the reason.


Both those statements serve to influence a person to contribute. The first one appeals to the person to empathize with a situation while the second statement helps guilt-trip the individual. Both views are aimed toward getting a contribution. However, one is used ethically while the other is unethical or dark persuasion.


_
      


Appealing to Trust

 – if an individual trusts and 

believes you, it becomes easier to influence them. Most psychopaths make sure their victims trust them, which is how they can persuade them. It is almost impossible to affect an individual that doesn’t trust you. Trust is vital if one is to be convinced. For example:


If an individual seems to be doing well financially and tells you to take a position in something, they might say to you to trust them; that is how they began. They know you desire to have financial stability, and you will believe them because you may know their story.


If this person is genuine, then you are likely to have made a good investment. However, embezzlers, on the other hand, are people that also are trusted by people who invest with them. They convince their victims to take a position in a particular thing because it pays. You trust them because they appear to have a good reputation and understand what they are doing. Unfortunately, this person appeals to your trust to invest your hard-earned money, but they swindle you. This manner is often dark persuasion in play. All the people that have had their funds embezzled trusted their embezzlers.


_
      


Plain people

 – manipulators know to influence their victims or audience; they need to appear to be an average kind of person. For instance, politicians use persuasion tactics to get voters. He or she may say: “I am an average person. I relate to the suffering we have endured under the present leadership, and it is time we changed the narrative. I have grown up with you in this neighborhood, I have faced the same challenges, and therefore, I'm the best candidate.”


This appeal aims to point out that a politician is an average person, a bit like the voters. The politician wants the voters to believe he can 

relate with them because he is ordinary. Whether the knowledge is proper or not, whether the politician wants votes and will do something, he will manage to convince the electorate through such statements.


_
      


Bandwagon

 – This is often the presumption that everybody trusts it, so it must be right or true. This way is often quite common in advertisements. For instance: a corporation advertising its toothpaste brand may claim that 2 out of each American household use this product. It has been trusted by families for generations to supply the best in cavity protection.


No one wants to have cavities. If you are convinced that that product is the favorite bestseller and most people trust it, you will buy it. It is important to remember that some of these statistics aren't true. No matter if the merchandise does perform as indicated, companies can come up with untruths to push sales of a product.


Bandwagon is additionally a tactic used majorly on social media. If an individual notices many likes regarding a specific product, they leap out to shop for it. The idea is that if many love it, it must be good. However, it may be the advertisement that was well crafted and not the merchandise.


_
      


Rhetorical Question

 – when an individual wants to persuade another, they are going to use rhetorical questions. For instance, if an individual is promoting a skincare regiment, they will ask their audience, “Who wouldn’t wish to have fair glowing skin?” the solution is clear. It provokes the person to think and ant to have flawless skin and find yourself buying the merchandise.


Another person might want to sell you shares, knowing quite an ell that the share value is probably going to drop. They show you 

influential figures and ask you, “wouldn’t you like to make money?” Even the richest person in the world wants to make more money! This type of tactic will end up convincing you to take a position even though it might be a wrong investment.


How to Exit or Defend Yourself Preventively


There will consistently be individuals trying to shake your confidence or individuals trying to ingrain seeds of self-question inside you. Such individuals would do their very best to fool you into believing that their assessments are fair realities. They confide in you that everybody on the earth believes you are impolite, nuts, or not adequate. At that point, they will tell you how much they are stressed over you, how you are carrying on with your life, spending your cash, bringing up your youngsters, and so on.


If you do not change the way they need you to change, your life will be destroyed. That is what they want you to believe. They want to have you under control. They want you to change, not to make your life better, but to validate their lives and keep you from overgrowing them.


Don't get angry. Manipulative people aren't preoccupied with your needs. They believe in their interests. If you accept manipulative people in your life, it is often incredibly challenging to get rid of them. The trick is to have enough self-control to send the boot to dishonest people as soon as you see them. Here are a couple of ways to get rid of manipulative people from your life:


Don’t fall into Their Trap


Many people encounter instances where others seek to control our feelings, attitudes, or actions and cash in on them to their own benefit. You fail to know the particular motive of one such case. The 

person mentally dominates you, and you step into Hell. Sometimes this emotional manipulation costs you a lot when you make some critical decisions under another person's influence and when it is too late, you realize that later.


You must be cognizant when a relationship sounds unrealistic. The partners are supplying you with empathy, appreciation, esteem, congrats, and fondness. You sense that you sleep in a fantasy where everything appears to be great... they do not offer you a reason to stress. You actually cannot find any flaws in them. And if anything goes wrong, they will begin to weep or feel sorry. You might even become the victim of intense sex and feel a love for the fairy tale.


It was the result when you began the relationship with adoration shelling, and out of nowhere, you start feeling disregarded. You are getting gratefulness, endowments, acclaim, yet once in a while, you have a sense that you are losing your grasp or having another person in your life. You get another gift from them the instant you make up your mind to move on. You discover it hard to make your mind up. They are trying to get control over you in one situation like this. In most cases, this works to your amazement. You approach them even more.


People often succeed in manipulating their victims after intermittent reinforcement. They may stop behaving in the same way when fighting back or demanding an explanation. The reason is that they are taking complete care of you now so that they say goodbye to the intermittent strengthening. They do not need it. Manipulators have several different faces and may use several different ways to get things done in the same way.


The person may make an undertaking and later deny that you simply begin to doubt your own perception. They do cause you to feel bad 

when you try hard to make them conscious of their pledge. They will use superficial sympathy and burst into crocodile tears. Eventually, you end up trusting them and even doubting that you heard correctly.


You can't believe smiling faces that appear confident and powerful. Manipulative people often have self-serving prejudice so that they think less for the other person's feelings. They need a reason to look for others who affirm them and make them even feel superior.


Steer Clear Whenever Possible


A manipulator's actions typically vary according to the situation they are in. For instance, a manipulator could speak rudely to one person, and the next moment acts politically toward another. When you frequently notice such extremes in a person, staying far away from them would be advisable. Don't interact with this person unless you do have to. That will prevent you from becoming a deceptive victim.


One way to spot a manipulator is to check how individuals behave in several circumstances and before different people with different faces. Although we all have a degree of this type of social distinction, some psychological manipulators seem to habitually dwell in extremes, being highly polite to one person and totally gross to another-or helpless at one moment, and fiercely violent at another. When you regularly observe this behavior from a person, keep a healthy distance away, and avoid engaging with the person unless you need to. As described earlier, there are nuanced and deep-seated explanations for chronic psychological abuse. Changing or saving these isn't your job.


There are some circumstances in which you cannot entirely leave a relationship-most, usually when that person happens to be a parent 

or an extended family member. You certainly can't go cold turkey unless the person causes significant harm or psychological damage. First, you would like to accept this person entirely for who they are and alter your relationship expectations accordingly. If they were someone you needed validation from before, then you'd need to quit trying to find their confirmation. Recognize that their advice isn't something you would like in your life if they were someone you received guidance from. If they keep offering it, you can thank them for it, then politely dump it.


When setting these boundaries, be as subtle as you can, and don't tell the other person you are setting them. This alteration would require some energy at your end; when you anger the other person in the process, you will have to deal with their reaction on top of that.


Knowing this may drain your energy slightly, setting limits around the time you spend that person. If you have been hanging out every Saturday with your manipulating mother-in-law, cut it right down to once a month and plan something for that day so that there is a particular end time for your hangout.


Call Them Out On Their Behavior


Manipulators are always challenging to deal with, but the worst are covert manipulators. They are going to stay calm as a cucumber when confronted, and yet rigid and unbending. You would possibly start to get frustrated when you start spotting their flawed logic. If you keep arguing with them, you will find it hard not to raise your voice a bit. You are going to start out looking just like the crazy one, and they are going to try to take back control of staying calm, based on their “maturity."


Defending yourself is enticing, and trying to get the other person to see what is happening. But an accurate manipulator won't alter their 

tune, and the further you give in to that temptation to protect yourself, the other they are going to twist your words. It will not be long before you get trapped in this distorted web of lies and false perceptions. When you are in a situation with a real manipulator, the two objectives for any conflict that are happening will be to resolve and leave, whether meaning leaving the present discussion or leaving the relationship. Evite threats, complaints, lose patience, accuse the other person of coercion, or become excessively emotional. Stick to honest, factual, and respectful declarations when you speak.


Some things need a high degree of intelligence, flexibility, or self-discipline when handling a manipulative person. You would possibly not have the self-control to react without losing your temper and making things worse. If that is the case, accept this about yourself and take extra measures to stop a tense confrontation (invite a mediator into the conversation, for instance, or send an email rather than meeting face to face, so you have got time to think about what you say).


To me, it can generate a bit of anxiety to deal with someone who loses their temper. I needed to bring a friend with me to feel secure in circumstances where there were many blow-up risks. However, as much as I wanted to handle the argument myself, I noticed that I wasn't yet in a position to do so. I might have felt lots of unnecessary discomfort if I had not acknowledged this about myself due to my decision to act stronger than I was. Wouldn't you be better at handling the matter than you are? People will be judging the vulnerable points, and making it seem like the subject will be easier for you to deal with than it is. Do not equate your reaction to someone else's response in one case.









Emotions and Empathy


Another critical psychological concept you will understand before delving into the mysteries of dark psychology is empathy. This way is often another one of those shared traits across most of humanity, although some people do struggle with it. It is one of those defining features that evolved to assist in survival. It is incredibly important to know because, like emotions, it is highly motivating. This feeling means that you will understand how to get people to do what you want or control them with your own feelings, knowing that compassion will pick up on them if you know empathy.


Have you ever had a moment in which you looked at another person and exactly understood what they were feeling, regardless of how inexplicable the phenomenon may have been? Perhaps you checked out a homeless beggar on a corner and suddenly felt intense loneliness, pain, and shame just by looking. That is empathy.


What is Empathy?


Empathy allows people to understand the emotions of somebody else. Through a look, once you are an empathetic individual, you can exactly tell what somebody else is feeling as if you, yourself, are feeling the same pain. You can put yourself in the shoes of the other person, intimately understanding their feelings and recognizing exactly how it impacts them. You can nearly understand, identify, and feel their psychological state.


Empathy is a strange ability; it is usually done at a glance and can be done by someone sitting in a room with strong emotions. Those who are empathetic are ready to devour on subtle cues, like the strain in the room or the way people are holding and presenting themselves 

and recognizing what must be done one way or the other. Typically, because they are so willingly able to feel what others are feeling, Highly empathetic individuals go above and beyond to help those around them.


Types of Empathy


Three major types of empathy show up throughout life, and each serves a somewhat different purpose. Ultimately, people are best suited with a mixture of the three empathies, but being incredibly empathetic in all three types is slightly uncommon. These three types of kindness are emotional empathy, cognitive empathy, and compassionate empathy.


Emotional empathy


Emotional empathy refers to your ability to feel what somebody else is feeling. When you see someone exhibiting strong emotions, you can scan things and precisely understand what is supposed by the other person. You will be sensitive to the vibes in a room or recognize the tension. Regardless of how you can sense the tension, struggles, and emotions, you regularly are uncontrollably overwhelmed with the other person's feeling as if you are in their shoes.


For example, if you walk down the road and see a young child, scared and sobbing, with no adults around, you may feel your heart panging in fear and sorrow. You understand that the kid is probably terrified and that the parent is also terrified, and you think that very same fear. That is emotional empathy. You see and understand the emotions.


Cognitive Empathy


On the other hand, with cognitive empathy, you may be able to look 

at someone and understand their emotions at a glance; you do not feel them the same way the emotional empath does. You may see the crying child and understand precisely why the kid is crying, but you do not feel the same overwhelming feeling of your fear in response. Instead, you can look and rationalize why the kid is crying—in this case, because he is lost, and young children naturally crave to be with their parents—and having the ability to stay rational and levelheaded are often quite beneficial. You can predict what the kid will do next—likely run away screaming or collapsing on the floor and continuing to sob uncontrollably—and in having the ability to expect, you can then make sure you are tweaking your behaviors accordingly. This particular branch of empathy is incredibly important when considering the way to influence and persuade people.


Compassionate Empathy


Separate from the other two empathies, compassionate empathy is a kind of combination of the two. Consider this as the most enlightened of the empathies—it allows the individual to see someone else and understand intimately what that other person goes through. The compassionate empath considers the pain of the other person and feels it. It adds the layer of cognitive empathy as well—the individual can also understand the thoughts of the other party and make predictions based on behaviors when trying to understand what is happening. Those two empathies combine, and the individual is left feeling a strong desire to help others around him or her. The individual feels motivated in feeling the emotions and understanding the thoughts of the other person. This way is often the mark of a good leader—it is someone who can see and understand and genuinely want to help those around him or her.


Purpose of Empathy


Similar to emotions, empathy has one principal purpose. It is tasked with ensuring a far better chance for the survival of the species. This fact is often accomplished through three separate steps that are integral to empathy as a whole. These three key concepts are communication and bonding, regulating one’s behaviors, and inspiring selflessness. Each of those three concepts aids the survival of humanity in several ways.


Communication and bonding


When you can recognize and feel these around you's emotions, you are better equipped to speak and bond. Consider it this way—if you understand that your neighbor is stressing out over trying to get a fence patched up before the rainstorm that weekend, you can see what your neighbor needs and offer to alleviate some stress. In understanding the other person’s unconscious cues and seeing how you can lessen the discomfort, you can submit a solution, which inspires and facilitates bonding between the 2 of you. By recognizing when those around you need help and responding similarly, you can develop relationships that will serve you well.


Regulation of own behaviors


When you can see how people understand your behaviors, you get valuable insight that will be used to regulate yourself. Suppose you see that somebody is disinterested in what you are talking about, for instance. In that case, you see a cue to change the topic to something else or to present what you are discussing in a way that will bring the other person back to the conversation. This fact will go one step further—if you see that somebody is being hurt or upset by your words or actions, you are much more likely to want to stop what you are doing once you empathize with the other person. When 

you imagine how you'd feel with roles reversed, you are more likely to want to stop because you understand how you'd think in the same position. Understanding and regarding the other’s pain allows you to manage your behaviors.


Encouraging selflessness


Lastly, empathy seeks to encourage selflessness. By regulating yourself and communicating, you are more inclined to want to help others through the two purposes above. Think of it this way—if you saw your ally struggling and you had the means to alleviate that suffering, would you do it? Most people would say yes; they would—no one enjoys watching people they love suffer in misery on their all alone. This way serves an additional purpose as well— once you help those around you, they are much more likely to want to return the favor when you need a hand. When people behave selflessly, the whole group is way more likely to survive. For instance, if you give your neighbor some food because they are out, your neighbor is far more likely to stop and assist you when they see that something has broken and needs patching to be functional again.


With these three fundamental purposes of empathy working together, people can live in relative peace when surrounded by one another. They will want to assist one another to survive, and successively, they will want to help still one another survive when most are looking for the best interest of everyone else.


Developing Empathy in Your lifestyle


Here’s the thing, you are an empathetic person, or you are not. You can't switch empathy off or on whenever you are feeling like it. You also cannot refer to that one occasion when you were empathetic in 2009, then try to pass yourself as an individual that's filled with 

empathy. To be considered empathetic, you must commit to your lifestyle skill in the same way that an individual must tell the truth on more than one occasion before they will be considered truthful.


Lucky for you, becoming more empathetic is pretty straightforward. The most crucial obstacle you will face on your journey toward empathy is yourself. Why? Because nine out of ten times, people tend to be self-absorbed. Empathy involves you giving away some room in your life for people and their thoughts and feelings. Here are some practical tips that you can apply in your life to get better at empathy:


Tip #1: Listen More Than You Talk


A Greek philosopher named Epictetus summarized the importance of listening more than talking like this: we have two ears and one mouth to listen twice as much as we speak. Unfortunately, today's world is such that everybody is talking, and no one seems to be listening. As long as you are talking, you will never really tell what the other person is thinking or feeling. It is essential to pause and let people speak because that is the most avenue through which thoughts, perspectives, and emotions are often communicated.


The best kind of listening is what is known as active listening. In other words, you want to listen in a way that shows you are invested in the conversation. Sitting across from your conversation partner without saying one word or while watching them, blankly will only make them feel uncomfortable and uncared for.


Active listening is pretty easy to achieve. The first thing you have to do is put away all distractions aside. This fact means that you shouldn't check your phone for Facebook updates while your friend or colleague is pouring their heart out to you. Checking your phone or doing other things while your friend is trying to have a heart-to-

heart conversation with you is incredibly rude and in poor taste. Instead, put away all distractions and focus your attention on the person speaking. Steady eye contact lets them know that they are essential and that you are listening.


You do not want to get all creepy with your eye contact to the extent the other person begins to feel as if you are staring. An ingenious way to maintain appropriate eye contact is to lock eyes for five seconds then look away. At this point, you ought to not be staring but instead gazing at them softly and with compassion.


However ridiculous the story could be, never roll your eyes at an individual who is opening up to you about something. Remember, they are feeling those emotions and thinking those thoughts because the experience was valid to them. Even if you think crying over a dead goldfish is overly dramatic, don't let these thoughts show on your face.


At the same time, you would like to ensure that your active listening is peppered with just the proper amount of insightful questions. Ask open-ended and non-judgmental questions that help them prolong the basis explanation for their troubles. The idea of active listening is to stimulate the other party to solve their own making. All along, the other party will believe you solved their issue when actually, you only listened and gave them a platform to rant and bounce off the solutions they already had in their mind.


Let’s say, for example, your friend comes to you complaining about their partner. They have been together for two years, and your friend is beginning to feel as if she won't be the right partner for him based on how she has been behaving.


Friend: I don’t know; it just feels as if she is taking me for granted.


You: Why do you say so?


Friend: Just the other day, I came home early and cleaned the house and did the laundry with great care so she could relax and enjoy our date night. She cannot enjoy a date night as long as the unfinished household duties are at the back of her mind. And you know what she said?


You: What did she say?


Friend: Nothing. Absolutely nothing. She didn't even act as if she had noticed all the hard work I put into it.


You: have you ever considered talking to her about it?


Friend: No. Not really. Do I even have to?


You: it might help to get her perspective. What do you think her attitude is?


Friend: Well, she does the same household duties, and that I don't exactly hold a parade for her. I assume she didn't see the big deal about me helping.


You: …


Friend: Oh yes, that’s probably it. Why is it a big deal when I do it and not a big deal when she does it? I should probably check the social conditioning I have received on the expected gender roles in society.


You: Yes, just like the incontrovertible fact that dads are parents too and not babysitters.


Friend: Ha-ha, exactly!


The whole point of this conversation is to point out that you can flow with your partner without imposing your beliefs and perspectives on them and still allowing them to get as much as they want off their chest. Sooner or later, they will get to their-ha moment where they 

solve their problem and continue their merry way. The fact of the matter is that you will get the credit for the solution, and they will leave believing that you are the epitome of empathy.


Tip #2: Allow Yourself to be Vulnerable


Being vulnerable is horrifying. Allowing people to see the most sensitive parts of you can feel like making yourself an easy mark. However, people must see you for the person that you are. We are all flawed in our different ways, and that we have our fears and flaws. We feel things and that we worry too. When someone is brave enough to be vulnerable with you, do yourself a favor and permit yourself to point out that side of you that you would instead not show under the other circumstances. Self-disclosure is not intended to take away attention from the other party. Instead, it is a way of making mutual affection and making the other person feel that you understand what they are going through.


Let’s say, for example, your friend comes to you with marriage troubles. They have run into tough times with their spouse after using up the graces of the honeymoon period. They are confused and can't find out what they have to do to repair things. A method of being vulnerable with them is letting them know that you had also experienced the same phase when you got married. You are not trying to talk ill of your spouse or marriage; rather, you are letting your friend know that it is human to go through what they are going through. After this disclosure, your friend will feel more connected to you and more trusting of what you have to say regarding their little problem.


Tip #3: Put Your Assumptions and Judgments Aside


We all have preconceived notions about things that are based on our 

own experiences and understanding of issues. When a lover is lamenting their misfortune, it is often tempting to rush to what we expect we all know is an attempt to offer them some comfort. Unfortunately, doing so is usually a problem instead of a solution. As difficult as it could also be, you must put all of your assumptions and judgments aside and focus on seeing the world as your friend sees it. Empathy is patient. It is not something that is rushed to advance to the next one that needs it. Repeatedly, empathy requires that you shut up about what you know and allow the other person to tell you what they know or think they know.


You will not always interact with people that share your world views. You would possibly even have friends who believe in ridiculous things. Regardless, you won't always be prepared to undertake and understand where they are coming from, rather than trying to change who they are.


Tip #4: Use Your Imagination


The chances are high that you will get to be empathetic toward people going through experiences that you have not experienced. In such instances, how are you expected to be empathetic? It is simple. You only need to use your imagination. You do not need to have experienced labor to understand that childbirth is often a really painful experience. You need to imagine how excruciating it must be to use your body to bring forth a human being into the world.


You can stir up your imagination by reading and allowing your mind enough space to roam uninhibited. Your mind can take you on adventures that no airplane can, so whenever possible, let it guide you. Of course, if you have not experienced something, don't use your imagination to mislead others. A person who uses his vision to inform a lady in labor that he went through the same thing five years 

before is an outright liar. And you know what doesn't go well with empathy? Lies. Lies don't quite fit into the same space as empathy.


Tip #5: Tune into the Welfare and Needs of Others


Empathy isn't something you throw at others when you wake up in the morning or when you show up at work. For there to be empathy, there has got to be something that hinders another person's well-being. You can't empathize with another person just because they exist. However, you can empathize with another person about the heartbreak or hardship that they are going through.


Every person has what they prioritize as their primary needs outside of the universal basic needs. When these needs aren't met, an individual might consider themselves to be undergoing suffering. For instance, if you need to be loved (and most people do), getting dumped by a significant other can induce a lot of suffering.


When you comfort someone in this state, you want to approach it from the point of view of their needs. Even if you think that the one that dumped your friend/colleague isn't exactly a catch, you have to keep those thoughts to yourself then look at it from the perspective of your friend’s welfare. Being attuned to people’s interest is particularly critical in empathetic concern because it is only by knowing what's missing from someone’s life that you can often replace it.









How to Analyze People


It is about understanding, beyond words, what people intend to state. It is to do with sensing what they genuinely indicate, even when they say otherwise. The power to review individuals correctly will significantly influence your social, individual, and job life.


When you comprehend how one more individual feels, you can then adapt your message and communication style to ensure it is obtained in the best means possible. It isn't that tough. This might appear motto, but you do not require special powers to know how to read people precisely. So, below are suggestions for analyzing individuals like a pro:


Be Open-Minded and Unbiased


Before you try to analyze an individual, you want first to exercise having an open mind. Don't allow your emotions as well as previous experiences, influence your impressions, and also viewpoints. If you evaluate individuals easily, it may cause you to misread individuals. Be determined to come close to every interaction and situation. According to Judith, "Reasoning alone won't tell you the entire story concerning a person. You would like to open up to various other crucial forms of information. This fact to make sure that you can learn to check out the crucial non-verbal, intuitive signs that people release." She says that to ascertain an individual plainly, you ought to "continue to be unbiased and acquire information neutrally without distorting it."


Take Notice of Appearance


Judith Orloff says that when reading others, try to look at 

individuals' appearance. What are they putting on? Are they clothed for success, which indicates they are ambitious? Or are they wearing denim as well as a t-shirt, which suggests comfort?


Do they have a pendant, for instance, a cross or Buddha, which shows their spiritual worth? Whatever they use, you can discover something from it. Sam Gosling, an individuality psychologist at the University of Texas as well as the author of guide Snoop, claims that you need to take note of "identification insurance claims.” These are points individuals pick to point out with their looks, like a t-shirt with slogans, tattoos, or rings.


Below's Gosling:


“Identification cases are intentional declarations we make concerning our perspectives, objectives, worths, etc. One of the things that are truly important to keep in mind concerning identification declarations is that since these are purposeful, many individuals assume we are manipulative with them and insincere. Still, I feel there is little proof to suggest that it takes place. I assume, normally, people truly do wish to be known. They will also do this at the expense of looking good. They'd preferably be seen authentically than positively if it came down to that selection." Also, some findings recommend that possibly mental attributes can-- to some extent-- be read on an individual's face.


Vinita Mehta Ph.D., Ed.M. discusses in Psychology Today:


“Higher degrees of Extraversion was related to even more protruding nose also as lips, a recessive chin, and masseter muscle mass (the jaw muscular tissues used in chewing). By contrast, the face of the people with lower Extraversion levels revealed the reverse pattern, in which the area around the nose showed up to push against the face. These findings for suggesting that perhaps 

emotional characteristics can-- to some degree-- be read on a person's face, though more researches would be needed to acknowledge this sensation."


Pay Attention to Individuals' Position


A person's pose says a whole lot about his/her attitude. If they hold their head high, it implies they are confident. If they stroll indecisively or cringe, it is going to be a symbol of reduced self-confidence. Judith Orloff M.D states that when it involves posture, check if they boldly hold their head high or walk indecisively or shrink, which shows low self-confidence.


See Their Physical Movements


More than words, individuals reveal their sensations through changes. For instance, we lean toward those we like and far away from those we do not. "If they are trying to lean in, if their hands are out and also open, hands reaching up, that is a superb indication that they are getting in touch with you," says Evy Poumpouras, a former United States Secret Service unique agent.


If you have observed that a man is leaning away, it indicates he or she is putting up a wall. An additional activity to note is the crossing of their arms or legs. If you see a person doing this, it suggests defensiveness, rage, or self-protection. Evy Poumpouras claims that "if somebody is leaning in and all of a sudden you say something, and their arms went across, now I understand I said something that he or she didn't like." On the other hand, concealing one's hands means they are hiding something from you. But if you see them biting their lips or cuticle picking, it indicates they are trying to reveal themselves under pressure or in an uncomfortable situation.


Try to Interpret Faces


Unless you are a master of that poker face, your feelings will be engraved on your front. According to Judith, there are so many ways to interpret faces. They are: when you see frown lines creating, it'd suggest the individual is worried or overthinking. A person that is giggling will reveal crow's feet-- the smile lines of joy. Another essential thing to look out for is pursed lips, which may indicate temper, contempt, or resentment.


Additionally, a clenched jaw and also teeth grinding are signs of tension. Affiliative smile: Includes pushing lips together while likewise making little dimples at the side of the mouth. Indicator of relationship and taste. Dominance smile: Upper lip is increased, and also cheeks get pressed upwards, the nose receives wrinkled, an indentation in between nose and mouth deepens, and increased top lids.


Don't Escape from Chitchat


Perhaps you are feeling anxious with chitchat. Nevertheless, it offers you the possibility to acquaint yourself with the other individual. Short talk helps you observe just how an individual behaves in typical scenarios. You can then use it as a standard to accurately detect any kind of habit that runs out of the ordinary. In the Quiet Language of Leaders: Exactly How Body Movement Can Aid or Hurt, Just How You Lead, the author mentions a spread of errors that people make when trying to read individuals, and also one of them was that they do not get a standard of just how they typically act.


Scan the Person's Total Behavior


We sometimes assume that if a particular action is completed, like 

looking at the ground during a discussion, it means the individual is nervous or distressed. Yet if you are already familiar with a person, you will know whether the individual prevents eye contact or is simply unwinding when she or he looks down the ground. According to LaRae Quy, a previous counterintelligence representative for the FBI, "people have various peculiarities and patterns of actions," and a couple of those behaviors "can simply be mannerisms." That is why developing a baseline of others' standard actions will help you. Learn precisely the way to determine any discrepancy from an individual's habits. You will understand something is wrong when you discover an adjustment in their tone, speed, or body language.


Ask Straight Questions to Get A Straight Response


To obtain a straight answer, you have to stay away from complicated matters. Always ask questions that require a linear response. Remember not to interrupt when the person is addressing your concern. Instead, you can observe the individual's quirks as they chat. INC recommends looking for "activity words" to understand how an individual assumes notification words and tone made use of.


When you talk with an individual, try to observe the words they use. When they claim, "This is my second promo," they need you to know that they also gained a former promotion.


Pay Attention To What Your Gut Says


Listen to your gut, especially when you initially meet a person. It will offer you a natural reaction before you have a chance to believe. Your alimentary canal will pass on whether you are comfortable or not with the individual. According to Judith Orloff M.D, "Sixth sense 

takes place quickly, primitive feedback. They are your inner reality meter, relaying if you can trust individuals."


Feel The Goosebumps, If Any


Goosebumps happen when we reverberate with individuals that move or influence us. It can occur when an individual is saying something that strikes home within us. "When we inspect research study [on the cools], beyond the evolutionary feedback to warm ourselves, it's songs that appear to cause it, also as relocating experiences as well as movies," stated Kevin Gilliland, a Dallas-based scientific psychologist. Also, we feel it when we experience deja-vu, an acknowledgment that you have known somebody previously, though you have never met the person.


Focus On Flashes Of Understanding


Often, you may get an "ah-ha" moment about people. But remain alert because these understandings can be done in a flash. We tend to miss it since we go on the next thought so swiftly that these crucial understandings obtained are lost.


Feeling The Individual's Presence


This fact means that we have to feel the general psychological atmosphere bordering us. When you read individuals, try to discover if the person has social visibility that attracts you; otherwise, you face a wall surface, making you back off. According to Judith Orloff M.D, presence is: "This is the general power we produce, not necessarily congruent with words or actions."


Enjoy Individuals' Eyes


They claim our eyes are the doorway to our spirits-- they transmit potent energies. So put in the time to watch individuals' eyes. When you look, are you able to see a caring spirit? Are they mean, upset, or safeguarded? According to Scientific American, eyes can "share whether we are lying or telling the truth." They can additionally "act as a superb detector of what people like" by considering the student dimension.


Don't Make Presumptions.


This way practically goes without saying; however, remember that assumptions cause misconceptions. When you easily make presumptions without also knowing the person, it brings a new problem. In the Quiet Language of Leaders: Exactly How Body Language Can Aid-- or Hurt-- Just How You Lead, the author aimed at numerous errors people make when checking out others. One of them was not understanding prejudices. For instance, if you think that your pal is angry, whatever they claim or do will undoubtedly appear as if concealed anger. Don't jump into verdict when your wife goes to sleep early instead of watching your preferred TV program with you. Perhaps she is merely tired—do not think she isn't interested in spending time with you. The key to reading individuals like a pro is to relax and keep your mind open and positive.


The Technique Of Watching Individuals


Technique makes ideal the more you examine individuals, the more you can read them accurately. As an exercise, try to practice seeing talk shows on mute. Seeing their faces and actions will help you understand what individuals feel when they are talking, without hearing any words. After that, watch another time with the volume turned on and check if you are right with your monitoring.









Influencing People


Being influential and persuasive is a skill that you can develop. With the proper tips and knowledge, you can master the art of influence and persuasion and apply it in various aspects of your life. If you are an entrepreneur or someone whose daily routine needs convince others to see things based on your perspectives and get them to agree with you, then mastering persuasion is a plus. You need to hone this kind of personality from the time you have chosen your career.


With excellent persuasion skills, it can be easier for you to present your new ideas to the general public. You can persuade the right partners to be a part of your network, create and propose solutions to the right people, convince potential investors to fund your ideas, and convince customers to shop from you.


The good news is that you can have this skill. Here are just a few ways for you to master the art of persuasion:


Practice Repetition


Repetition is an efficient way for you to get the attention of individuals. Many individuals, especially entrepreneurs, make the wrong assumption that their passion in their chosen field is enough to help them send their message to the right audience and stand out from the crowd. This way is often a wrong assumption because, with the excessive amount of data that the general public can access from various sources, it might be difficult for you to stand out. The majority of the general public today already created filters as a way of ignoring unsolicited inputs.


You can combat this by ensuring that you practice repetition. Note 

that you will presumably convince the general public that your message is worthy of being heard if they see and listen to it repeatedly – both in verbal and written form. The great news is that with this repetition, you can also imbibe the skill of persuasion into your personality, mainly because it aids you in mastering it.


Use Imagination


Another way to master the art of persuasion is to use your own and your target audience’s imagination. For example, you can say things like, “can you imagine how happy you will feel by buying this product?” This fact may give your audience the chance to color a picture of what they can expect to receive if he agrees to what you are saying or take what you are offering. Let him/her imagine the pleasure of following what you are suggesting and the pain that he/she will presumably feel if he/she doesn't.


Try to Obtain A Yes Early


If you are an entrepreneur, for example, then try to persuade your audience to agree with you, even in only trivial matters. It might be as simple as the weather, whether the color of an object is blue, politics, etc. Keep in mind that getting someone to love you is one of the essential aspects of persuasion. It might be possible for you to succeed in that goal if the person you are handling agrees with you.


If you are still a beginner in the art of persuasion, try to let your audience see the particular value you are offering. You should also clearly indicate what they will be missing if they decide not to have it. Take advantage of leading questions, like “do you want to,” “have you been eager to,” etc.


The questions should be leading enough that they are going to have a 

difficult time saying no. You would like to customize the inquiries to make sure that they suit the kind of conversation you are having with your audience to influence them to agree with you at the earliest possible time.


Build Your Confidence


You cannot expect to master the art of persuasion if you are not confident. Your audience should see how secure you are with what you are saying. How do you expect someone to believe what you are saying if you have doubts about it? Regardless of how competent you are, if your audience doesn't sense your confidence, then you may presumably lose the fight and be left unable to convince them.


When it involves building your persuasion skills, note that you can develop your confidence by fully understanding how important it is to facilitate a need. Keep in mind that many people need your help, and you hold the answers to a particular problem they are facing. Believe that what you are offering or saying is vital and may provide a solution to a problem – that is, no matter the sector you are in – whether you are in web design, foods, etc.


Keep in mind that somebody will always find your products, services, and solutions helpful. Believing that you have something that is of great value to someone can significantly increase your confidence, making it easier for you to convince/persuade someone.


Improve Your Listening Skills


The ability to concentrate on someone intently – whether it is your customers, friends, colleagues, starting entrepreneurs, small business owners, or industry experts – contributes a lot to successfully persuading someone. Through intent listening, you can 

learn more about the sector you are in. Try to listen more than speak. Note that the time you spent not talking is frequently the most vital moment since the other party will presumably feel that you are genuinely valuing his time.


Listening is additionally known to be one of the keys to being persuasive. In a study conducted in a business school in Columbia, researchers discovered that a lot of workers value listening skills too much that this led to the successful implementation of persuasion. With the set of experiments and tests they conducted, they determined that one’s ability to influence or influence has a tremendous relationship to the timing he chooses to be verbal when doing the act. Remember that even though you do not speak and merely listen, you can still persuade others to use body language and cues.


Learn How to Integrate Connection In All Your Persuasion Endeavors


Regardless of whom you are trying to influence/persuade, forging a connection is crucial. Keep in mind that there is an excellent likelihood for them to reply positively as humans if you used emotional appeals by connecting to them. The great philosopher Aristotle, for example, discovered that humans could be influenced if one uses a mixture of credible, logically argumentative, and emotional appeals. Using emotional appeals more also increases the number of individuals who are often persuaded.


If you are an entrepreneur who must persuade people most of the time, then you can also use and mirror that idea to your advantage. A wise tip is to attach to them on a more emotional level by matching your voice inflections, physical cues, and charisma. This 

way is often an enormous help in building a personal connection, thereby allowing the person you are talking to to realize that you have similarities. This fact may eventually forge a bond of trust.


Learn How to offer Praises


You also got to learn the art of giving praise when it involves developing your persuasion skills. If you only specialize in shooting people with your ideas without even taking note of them or making them feel that you also value them, they will feel they are insignificant. This way may cause them to specialize in mending their hurt egos, rather than listening intently to what you have today. The great news is that you are often more likable to them if you begin to supply them praise. Find something good about the person you are talking to and praise him.


Once he finds you likable through the praises you give, it will be easier for you to influence him to concentrate on you and agree with your idea. Praising someone can make him feel he is attaining his achievement. He will then like you more, and he will start thinking that you will be of great help to him when it involves reaching his full potential.


Just make sure that you are careful when offering praises, though. Avoid resorting to using empty praises. Doing so will only damage your efforts.









Body Language Analysis


Being able to communicate well is extremely important when wanting to succeed in the personal and professional world, but it isn’t the words you say that scream. It is your body language that does the screaming. Your gestures, posture, eye contact, facial expressions, and tone of voice are your best communication tools. These have the power to confuse, undermine, offend, build trust, draw others in, or make someone comfortable.


There are many times where what someone says and what their body language says is entirely different.


Non-verbal communication could do five things:


_
       

Substitute – It might be used in place of a verbal message.


_
       

Accent – It could underline or accent your verbal message.


_
       

Complement – It could complement or add to what you are saying verbally.


_
       

Repeat – It could strengthen and repeat your verbal message.


_
      

 Contradict – It could go against what you are trying to say verbally to make your listener think you are lying.


We are getting to cover:


_
      


Gestures

 – These are woven into our lives. You might speak animatedly; argue with your hands, point, wave, or beckon. Gestures do change according to cultures.


_
      


Facial expressions

 – you can learn that the face is expressive and shows several emotions without speaking one word. Unlike what you say and other types of body 

language, facial expressions are usually universal.


_
      


Eye contact

 – Because sight tends to be our most powerful sense for many people, it is a crucial part of Non-verbal communication. The way someone looks at you can tell you whether they are attracted to you, affectionate, hostile, or interested. It can also help the conversation flow.


_
      


Body movement and posture

 – Take a moment to think about how you view people based on how they hold their heads, stand, walk around, and sit. The way an individual carries their self gives you a lot of information.


No
n

-verbal communication could fail in several different ways. It is effortless to confuse other signals, and the rest of this chapter will make sure that won’t happen.


Lower Body


The arms share a lot of information. The hands share a lot more, but legs give us the exclamation mark and tell us precisely what someone is thinking. The legs could say to you if an individual is open and comfortable. They might also tell who dominance or where they need to go.


Legs Touching


When an individual is standing, they will only be able to touch their bottom or thighs. This way can be done seductively, or they might slap their legs as if they are saying, “Let’s go.” It can also indicate irritation. This way often is when you need to concentrate on the context of the conversation. This fact is very vital.


Pointing Feet


Look at the direction of a person’s feet to know where their attention 

is. Their feet will always point toward what is on their mind or what they are concentrating on. Everyone has a lead foot, and it all depends on their dominant hand. If an individual that we have an interest in is talking, our lead foot will be pointing toward them. But, if they want to leave the situation, you will notice their foot pointing toward an exit or the way they need to go. If an individual is sitting during the conversation, check out where their feet are pointing to see what they are genuinely interested in.


Smarty Pants


This way is a position where someone tries to make themselves look more prominent. They are going to be seated with their legs splayed open and leaning back. They might even spread their arms out and lock them behind their head. This way is generally used by people that feel dominant, superior, or confident.


Shy Tangle


This way is usually something that ladies do more than men. Anyone who begins to feel shy or timid will sometimes entangle their legs by crossing them under and over to block out bad emotions and make themselves look smaller. There is another shy leg twirl that people will do when they are standing. This movement's particular act is crossing one leg over the other and hooking that foot behind their knee as if they are trying to scratch an itch.


Upper Body


Upper body language can show signs of defensiveness since the arms could easily be used as a shield. Upper body language could involve the chest. Let’s check out some upper body language.


Leaning


If someone leans forward, it will move them closer to a different person. There are two possible meanings to this. First, I'll tell you that they are curious about something, which could be what you are talking about. But, this movement could also show romantic interest. Second, leaning forward could invade a person’s personal space; hence, this leads them as a threat. This way is often an aggressive display. This fact is usually done unconsciously by influential people.


The Superman


Bodybuilders, models commonly use this, and it had been made famous by Superman. This way might have various meanings depending on how an individual uses it. In the animal world, animals will try to make themselves look more significant when they feel threatened. If you check out a domestic cat, they will stretch their legs and their fur stands on end when they get spooked. Humans also have this; even it isn’t as noticeable. This way is why we get goosebumps. Because we can’t make ourselves look more significant, we have to develop arm gestures like putting our hands on our waist. This fact shows us that an individual is preparing to act assertively.


This way is usual for athletes to do before a game or a wife who is nagging their spouse. A man who is flirting with a woman will use this to seem assertive. This way often is what we call a readiness gesture.


The Chest in Profile


If an individual stands sideways or at a 45-degree angle, they are trying to intensify their chest. They might also push out their chest, more on this in a minute. Women do that posture to show off their breasts, and men will do that to show off their profile.


Outward Thrust Chest


If someone pushes their chest out, they try to draw attention to the present part of their body. This way might even be used as a romantic display. Women understand that men are programmed to be aroused by breasts. If you see a lady pushing her chest out, she could be inviting intimate relations. Men will push out their chest to show off their chest and possibly trying to cover their gut. The difference is that men will do that to women and other men.


Hands


Human hands have 27 bones, and they are an expressive part of the body. This way provides us a lot of capability to handle our surroundings.


Reading palms isn’t about just watching the lines on the hands. After a person’s face, the hands are the best source for body language. Hand gestures are different across cultures, and one hand gesture could be innocent in one country but very offensive in another.


Hand signals could also be small, but they show what our subconscious is thinking. A gesture could be exaggerated and done using both hands to point out something.


Control


If an individual is holding their hand with their palms facing down, they could be figuratively holding onto or restraining another person. This way might be an authoritative action that is telling you to stop now. It can be an invitation asking you to calm down. This fact will be apparent if someone places their dominant hand on top of a handshake. If they are leaning on their desk with their palms flat, this shows dominance.


If their palms face outward toward another person, they could be trying to fend them off or push them away. They could be saying, 

“stop, don’t come closer.”


If they are pointing their finger or their entire hand, they could be telling someone to go away now.


Greeting


Our hands get used a lot to greet people. The most common way is with a handshake. Opening up the palm shows they don’t have any weapons. This way gets used when saluting, waving, or greeting others.


At this point, we get to touch another person, and it will send various signals.


Dominance is often shown by shaking hands and placing the other hand on top. How long and how strong they shake the indicator will tell you that they are deciding when to prevent the handshake.


Affection might be shown with the handshake's duration and speed smiles, and touching with the other hand. The similarity between this one and the dominant one could lead to a situation when a dominant person will pretend they are just friends.


Submission gets shows by placing their palms up. Floppy handshakes that are clammy along with a fast withdrawal also show a proposal.


Most handshakes use vertical palms, which will show equality. They will be firm but won’t crush and for the right amount of your time, so both parties know when they should let go.


Waving is an excellent way to greet people and can be performed from a long distance.


Salutes are usually done by the military, where a particular style is prescribed.


Holding


A person who has cupped hands shows they will hold something gently. They show delicacy or holding something fragile. Indicators that grip will show desire, possessiveness, or ownership. The tighter the fist, the stronger they are feeling a specific emotion.


If someone is holding their own hands, they are trying to comfort themselves. They might be trying to restrain themselves so that they can let somebody else talk. It might be used if they are angry, and it is stopping them from attacking. If they are wringing their hands, they are feeling too nervous.


Holding their hands behind their back will show they are confident because they are opening up their front. They will hide their hands to hide their tension. If one hand is gripping the other arm, the tighter and better the grip, the tenser they are.


Two hands might show various desires. If one hand is forming a fist, but the other is holding it back, this might indicate that they might wish to punch somebody.


If someone is lying, they are going to try to control their hands. If they are holding them still, you would possibly want to be a bit suspicious. Remember that these are just indicators, and you ought to search for other signals.


If someone seems like they are holding onto an object kind of like a pen or cup, this shows they are trying to comfort themselves. If an individual is having a cup but is holding it very close and is like they are “hugging” the cup, they are hugging themselves. Holding onto any item with both hands shows that they have closed themselves off from others.


Items could be used as a distraction to release nervous energy, like 

holding a pen, but they are clicking it off and on, doodling, or messing with it. If their hands are clenched together ahead of them, but they are relaxed, and their thumbs are resting on one another, it might be showing pleasure.


Shaping


Our hands have the power to chop our words into the air to stress the things we are saying and their meaning. We try to make a visualization.


If a person is trying to explain the fish, he caught during his fishing trip, and he might try to show the form by indicating it with his hands. He may additionally carve out a particular shape that he wants his ideal mate to be. Other gestures could be cruder once they hold specific body parts and move sexually.


Face


People’s countenance could help us find out if we trust or believe what they are saying. The most trustworthy expression will have a small smile and a raised eyebrow. This expression will sow friendliness and confidence.


We make judgments about how intelligent somebody is by their facial expressions. People that have narrow faces with a prominent nose were thought to be extremely intelligent. People who smile and have joyous words might be brilliant instead of someone who looks angry.


Mouth


Mouth movements and expressions are needed when trying to read body language. Chewing on their lower lip might indicate an individual who is feeling fearful, insecure, or worrying.


If they cover their mouth, this might show that they are trying to be 

polite if they are yawning or coughing. It might be an effort to cover up disapproval. Smiling is the best signal, but smiles are often interpreted in many ways. Smiles are often genuine, or they could be used to show cynicism, sarcasm, or false happiness.


Watch out for the following:


_
       


Their lips are pursed.




If an individual tightens their lips, it could be a symbol of distaste, disapproval, or distrust.


_
       


They bite their lip.




People will bite their lips if they are feeling anxious, worried, or stressed.


_
       


They cover their mouth.




If an individual tries to cover a reaction, they could protect their mouth from hiding a smile or smirk.


_
       


Their mouth is turned up or down.




Changes in the mouth that are subtle could be a symbol of how the person is feeling. If their mouth is turned up a bit, they could be feeling happy or optimistic. If their mouth is turned down, they might be feeling sadness, disapproval, or grimacing.


Negative Emotions


The silent signals that you show might harm your business without you even knowing it. We have over 250,000 facial signals and 700,000 body signals. Having poor body language could damage your relationships by sending other indications that you can’t be trusted. They could turn off, alienate, or offend other people.


You have to keep your body language in restraint, and this takes a lot of effort. Most of the time, you may not know that you do it, and you would possibly be hurting your business and yourself.


There are various body language and speech mistakes that you can learn to stop managing your signals. Here are some mistakes you have to avoid:


Not Enough Response


If you are talking with someone, you would like to make sure you hear them. This way means you have to smile, nod, and make eye contact. Even though two people don’t agree with what one another says, you would like to let them know that you have heard what they said. This way is showing them respect. If you don’t do this, you may leave a wrong impression.


Using the Word “But”


Continually using the word “but” while you are talking can cause many problems. Most of the time, this may sound like you are just trying to make up some excuses or don’t care about what they are saying. You might say: “I am sorry that your product didn’t get to you on time, but you know how the weather is.” This statement doesn’t show you are sorry. You are placing the blame on the weather rather than addressing the critical problem.


Personal Space


Invading another person’s personal space can have detrimental results. One exemplar is that men always seem to invade a woman’s personal space whether or not they realize it. This way might cause some harassment lawsuits. The best area to keep between you et al. is about one and a half feet. Never treat another person’s space as if it was your own.


Talking Too Fast


Blinking fast or talking too quickly shows nervousness and distrust. Try to pause between each sentence and let others finish their 

sentence before your interrupt. Eye contact is significant. If you have a tough time looking people in the eye, look at the center of their forehead. It is like eye contact without all those uncomfortable feelings.


Not Listening


It doesn’t matter what you are doing for a living; you will need to talk with people some time or another. The main thing that will make or break any relationship is not listening. Listening could impact your relationship with employees, suppliers, performance, and scales better than other types of communications.


Slumping


If an individual slumps in their seat, they show that they don’t have any energy or confidence. It is important to show passion and let others know that you believe in yourself. If you are hunched over or slumping, you are sending the wrong message. If your posture is strong, you will feel energetic, and it can be a win for every person involved.


Checking Your Phone


If you are in a public gathering, put away your phone. Everybody is hooked to their phones now, and this is extremely rude. Try engaging with others, and stop checking your phone every minute. If you have got an emergency, that is fine. It is easier to create connections with others if you don’t have things distracting you.


Face is Scrunched-Up


You might not realize that your face is scrunched-up or that your brow is furrowed. This way will make others think you are intimidating or hostile. You might discourage others from being open, or it can make them get defensive. You can verbally assure 

them that you understand and support what they are saying.


Not Making Eye Contact


I used to work with someone who would immediately stare into space anytime somebody talked to them. Somebody claimed it was easier for them to focus on what others said if they didn’t check out who was talking. People might use many various communication types but always make eye contact. Even if you keep moderate eye contact, it will communicate confidence and interest and make everybody comfortable.


Not Smiling


Do you know that smiling can make you feel happy? People like to believe the opposite. If you can keep a pleasant smile on your face, you will feel more confident, and other people will want to work with you. If you realize you would like to make a face, turn that face into a smile.


Glancing Around


Everybody has encountered someone who will always look around while they are talking to you. It probably causes you to think that everybody is trying to find somebody else to talk to. Don’t be this person. Everyone you speak to needs to be treated with respect.


Handshake Too Weak or Strong


Handshakes are usually the first impression that somebody gets from you. If your handshake is just too weak, it'll show you are not professional, and it might be new to them. If your handshake is just too firm, it might warn them that you are too aggressive. Try to find a cheerful medium so that you will make a good impression.


When you observe people, you will pick up on their emotions by their Non-verbal signals. These indicators are not a guarantee. 

Contextual clues could be used, additionally to what they are saying and what is happening around you at the time.









Neuro-Linguistic Programming


Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) has got to do with the study of thoughts (neuro) and language (linguistic) in a systemic way and the scripts that run the life of a person (programming).


It deals with the understanding and development of the mind and the entire understanding of the mind's language about how it is designed to function and how the private experiences of a person mold it. It is a study of an individual's subjective reality.


A proper understanding of the mind's language influences every aspect of a person’s life, from his relationship with others to his communication skills with friends and clients to the overall outcome of a person’s life. It is a holistic study that puts the spirit, body, past, and present of a person into consideration.


As Homo sapiens who are gifted with the power to think, it is presumed that our most vital function is the thought or the thinking function. NLP, however, brings one to the understanding of the very fact that no thought process exists in a vacuum, as they are a product of an individual's perspective. It is a presupposition of perception as reality, and it holds that the things we think are colored by the way we think.


For different individuals, there are alternative ways of thinking and interpreting reality. What NLP does is help in the understanding of those various representational systems to assist everyone in narrowing down his approach. It helps in the knowledge of the three different types of thinking patterns, which are:


_
       

Visual: deals with both pictures and visual metaphors.


_
       

Auditory: sound (hearing).


_
       



Kinesthetic: deals with the five senses, also as gut feelings.


In NLP, an individual is assumed to take absolute control of his mind and, ultimately, his life. Unlike what is obtainable in psychoanalysis, which focuses on “why,” NLP presents a more practical approach with its focus on the “how.”


How NLP Works


If you are just seeing this subject for the first time, NLP may appear or appear to be magic or hypnosis. When an individual is undergoing therapy, this subject digs deep into the patient's unconscious and filters through different layers of beliefs and the person's approach or perception of life to deduce the first childhood experiences that are liable for a behavioral pattern.


In NLP, it is believed that everybody has the resources that are needed for positive changes in their own lives. The technique adopted here is supposed to assist in facilitating these changes.


Usually, when NLP is taught, it is done in a pyramidal structure. However, the most advanced techniques are left for those multi-thousand-dollar seminars. An effort to explain this complicated subject is to state that the NLPer (as those that use NLP will often call themselves) is usually paying keen attention to the person they are working on/with.


Usually, a large majority of NLPers are therapists, and they are very likely to be well-meaning people. They achieve their aims by listening to those subtle cues, just like the eye's movement, flushing of the skin, dilation of the pupil, and subtle nervous tics. It is easy for an NLP user to determine the following quickly:


_
       

The side of the brain that the person uses 

predominantly.


_
       

The sense (smell, sight, etc.) that is more dominant in a person’s brain.


_
      

 The way the person’s brain stores and uses data (the NLPer can deduce all this from the person’s eye movement).


_
       

When they are telling a lie or concocting information.


When the NLP user has successfully gathered all this information, they start to slowly and subtly mimic the client by taking over their body language and imitating their speech and mannerisms. They begin to speak with the language patterns aimed toward targeting the first senses of the client. They will typically fake the social cues, which will easily make someone let their guard down to become very open and suggestible.


For example, when a person’s sense of sight is their most dominant sense, the NLPer will use a very laden language with visual metaphors to speak with them. They ill to say things like: “do you see what I'm talking about?” or “why not check it out this way?” For an individual that has a more dominant sense of hearing, he is going to be approached with an auditory language like: “listen to me” or “I can hear where you are coming from.”


To create a rapport, the NLPer mirrors the body language and the other person's linguistic patterns. This rapport may be a mental and physiological condition that a person gets into once they lose their social senses. It is done when they begin to feel the other person they are conversing with is like them.


Once the NLPer has achieved this rapport, they will take hold of the interaction by leading it mildly and subtly. Due to the very that they have already mirrored the other person, they are going to begin to make some subtle changes to gain a particular influence on the 

person's behavior. This way is often combined with similar subtle language patterns, which cause questions and an entire phase of other techniques.


At this point, the NLPer is going to be able to tweak and twist the person to whichever direction they so desire. This way only happens if the other person can’t deduce that something is happening because they assume everything is occurring is organically or given consent to everything.


This way suggests that it is quite hard to make use of NLP to get people to act out of character, but it is often used to convey an individual to offer responses in their normal range of feelings. This way might come in the form of getting them to donate to a charitable cause, or finally making the choice that they had been adjourning or getting them to go home with you for the night if they had considered it at some point.


At this point, what the NLP user seeks to do could also be to either elicit or anchor. When they are stimulating, they use both leading and language to get the person to an emotional state of sadness. Once they can produce this state, they will then lead it on with a physical cue by touching the other person's shoulder, for instance.


According to theory, whenever the NLP user touches the person's shoulder simultaneously, the same emotional state will resurface if they are doing it again. However, this is often only made possible by the successful conditioning of the other person.


When undergoing NLP therapy, the therapist can adopt a content-free approach, which suggests the therapist can work effectively without taking a critical look at the problem or without even knowing about the matter in the least. This way indicates room for privacy for the client because the therapist doesn't need to be told 

about whatever happened or whatever issue happened in the past.


Also, before the therapy's commencement, there is an agreement that ensures that the therapist cannot disclose any information; hence the interaction between the therapist and the client remains confidential.


In NLP, there is a belief in the need for the perfection of human creation's character. So every client is inspired to acknowledge the senses' sensitivity and make use of them in responding to specific problems. NLP also holds the assumption that the mind can seek out cures to diseases and sicknesses.


The techniques employed by NLP have to do with a noninvasive, medicine-free therapy that permits the client to seek out new ways of handling emotional issues like low self-esteem, lack of confidence, anxiety, and destructive relationship patterns. It is also a successful tool in effective bereavement counseling.


With its roots in behavioral science, which was developed by Skinner, Pavlov and Thorndike, NLP uses the mixture of physiology and the unconscious to cause a change in the thought process and, ultimately, the behavior of an individual.


The Importance of NLP


Neuro-Linguistic Programming isn't only necessary for the understanding of an individual's being, but it also helps in the experience of the way a person is. It allows an individual to get deep into the root cause of the matter and the foundation of their being.


Here are other reasons why NLP is essential:


_
      

 It helps people take responsibility for the things that they feel they cannot be able to control. With NLP's 

assistance, an individual can change how they react to events of the past and have a particular level of control over their future.


_
      

 People need to remember the body language of the members of their clique and those they seek to do business with. With NLP, it is possible to use language with both control and purpose, and with this, it is possible to have control over your life.


_
      

 Remember, you can't expect to make the same mistakes using the same mindset and hope to get different results. During an NLP session, the main target is placed entirely on the client as they are made the subject. This fact helps a lot because, when an individual can deal with his or herself as an individual, they gain more clarity into his or her dealings with other people.


_
      

 It enhances finance, sales performance, marriage, health issues, parenting, customer service, and every other aspect and phase of life. This way often is because it helps in the holistic improvement of a person. When an individual is whole, his interactions and relationship with himself and people become whole as well.


_
      

 It assists in targeting your beliefs, thoughts, and values and helps target a person’s brain functions and develop certain behaviors. It also shapes how these behaviors metamorphose into habits and how they change to actions that successively come as results.


NLP applies to different vocations and professions. This way is often a vital tool in the mastery of sales, personal development experts and self-help, teaching, communication, parenting, and other facets of life.









Social Engineering with Dark Psychology


Human beings are social animals, and our interactions are commonly aimed towards changing our reality. Several dark psychology tactics help us bring about the change we want, whether it is about attracting a much bigger crowd, getting more lovers, or just raising our social status.


Advance Someone’s Goal


In a social gathering, everyone has their needs, and they are trying to find ways to get these needs met. Suppose you are trying to find how to expand your social following. In that case, it is not enough to appeal to your crowd's altruism, hoping they will encourage other people to become a part of your following, but you can get to expand your group by meeting the requirements of your followers. Look at what they are thirsting for and bring it to them, then you may ask for a favor. In this way, they are presumed to comply with your request and put an additional effort to impress you.


Tweak the Environment


If you would like someone to grant you a favor, you would consider tweaking the environment you ask them for the endorsement. As a social being, the person has to prove their worth, to uphold their reputation, and so, you must request the favor in an environment where the person would face disapproval should he decline. For example, if you favor asking from a lover, don’t ask when both of you are alone, but instead wait for a time when you are hanging out with friends, then ask for a favor. Since they will want to uphold their image as a supportive friend, they are likely to comply with the request.


Let the Other Person Speak First


When you are looking to get someone to drop their belief and acquire another one, you would like to concentrate keenly on what they say. In this way, you want to let the other person speak first. This way establishes their baseline, and it gives you good material on what to say and what not to say. Once you let the other person start speaking, you have an excellent chance to form a strong argument and get them to agree with your suggestions. When you allow them to talk first, they might think that you are respectful, which isn't entirely the case, but it helps them form a positive image about you, and they are inclined to grant your request.


Manipulating Facts


If you would like to get someone to do something, it helps manipulate the facts a bit. This way ensures they don’t have sufficient information when making a choice. Manipulation of facts isn’t almost telling lies. It is only getting the other person to have a flawed conception of truth. When you tell them a lie, it has to be a believable lie or raise the alarms, and they will go snooping around for your motives. The best way to manipulate facts is by telling the truth but withholding critical information or by cleverly mixing up the truth with half-truths and lies. This way enables them to imagine that you are telling the truth, and they have no reason to suspect your intention. If you would like to excite them into taking drastic action, you may exaggerate information. People are emotional, and the more you can push their emotional buttons, the quicker they are inclined to take cues.


Little Time to Make a Decision


To get someone to do what you want, you must not give them any time to think through their situation. This way allows their rational 

side to hold the day. You must keep the choice window pretty small. This fact forces them to make quick decisions based on their emotions mostly. For example, if you would like your friend to lend you money, make it appear to be a matter of life and death, that if they can't offer you the cash at that moment, it will not help matters should the coin be available at a later moment.


Disempowering Them


Another creative way to get people in your social circles to bend to your will is by taking their power away. One of the most effective methods of taking people’s control away is through cynical humor. Just ridicule them on how they are not knowledgeable about a particular domain or life in general. This way is a way of breaking their self-belief, and once you accomplish that, you can suggest what is right for them because you hold all the power. The disempowering shouldn't be done in an isolated and sincere manner. Still, it should be gradual, planting the seeds and watering them over time, and always remarking their inadequacies until they give into your power.


Consistent Judgment and Criticism


Another way to bend the people around you to your will is through never-ending criticism and judgment. Make it seem that they are the worst at doing something. When you are criticizing or judging, you must use the nastiest words to hurt their feelings. It would help if you were prepared even to lose them. However, your schedule is to interrupt their emotional state. The more you criticize, showing them that they are an enormous letdown, the higher it becomes to make them grant your request.


Confuse


Use the art of confusion to get people to do your bidding. Invent 

your realities and make them feel as if they are crazy. As numerous things from different sides bombard them, you can now make your move, and they are getting to be agreeable.


Scheme


If your target appears to be a troublesome nut to crack, you can scheme against them. You need the cooperation of other people. Look out for people that are willing to soil the reputation of someone, offer them something, then encourage them to tarnish the other person’s reputation, to disgrace them, so that their spirit is broken. Additionally, in the middle of all the heat, you can offer them a chance for reprieve under your terms.


Seduction Using Dark Psychology


Love is close to every human heart. When we are in love, nothing else seems to matter. Then we aren't always fortunate in love, in the sense that some people might not have partners at all, while people might not have access to partners they ant. Being unfulfilled in love is one of the worst feelings an individual could ever nurse.


Then dark psychology comes in aid. Dark psychology grants you the power to draw in people whom you would possibly have otherwise been unable to draw in. The following are some powerful unclear psychology principles for attracting romantic partners.


Be Indirect


One of the terrible mistakes people make while approaching potential lovers is to be super direct about their intentions. Additionally, this only serves to push aside that person. It makes them put their guards up, so moving forward becomes somewhat tricky. You ought to approach indirectly and create a false sense of security. Your target should first get used to having you around 

them. This fact enables you to establish a connection first before you can make things serious. You may even opt using a third party in the early stages. Strike when their guards are down.


Send Mixed Signals


You do not want to get into this person’s life and start straight away, expressing your undying love for them. You have the best chances of luring them by confusing them about your intentions. One moment, appear to be casual with them, and the next moment, provide a hint of wanting something more serious. This way could pique their interest so that they begin to wonder what you are about. If you are direct with your intentions, it erases the mystery and causes them to place their guards up. Sending mixed signals shows them that you have depth.


Make Them Hungry


Let’s face it; we are social animals. We want a piece of what everybody else appears to be after. If we are shunned by society, our worth goes down if we are deemed unworthy by the company. To get your target thirsty, you must make sure you portray yourself as some kind of an enormous deal; you have to make a reputation that precedes you. The more people mention you, the better. Once you have gotten them to notice you and understand that you are an enormous deal to many other people, it won’t be long before they give in.


Stir Anxiety and Discontentment in Them


A person who is contented is typically hard to draw in because they feel that they are enough. To make someone fall for you pretty quickly, you have to make it seem they lack something. Find a way of suggesting to them that they are incomplete. Considering that they already have you in mind, this suggestion should trigger anxiety and 

discontentment. Even as they start to wonder how to overcome this new crisis, present yourself as the answer to their problem. Get them to look at you as their savior.


Let Them Chase Your Attention


Once they realize that you hold the solution to their trouble, they will start trying to win your attention, but you want to be evasive. You must not concede wholly and allow them to do as they please. By giving them your full attention, you would be giving your power away. Instead, grace them with some attention, then advance to other things; this may cause them to start getting attached to you; they will begin to consider how they will have you all to themselves. You must be careful how you evade their attention, though, because you may find yourself sending the message of not being interested, which isn't what you want.


Create Temptation


Considering that people are extraordinarily complex, you don’t want to ant an open move, making clear your intentions; instead, you would like to cast a bait into the waters and wait to see whether they will willingly bite the hook. So, create temptation and observe whether or not they can bite at the hook. This way could offer you sufficient knowledge as to whether or not they are willing to play ball. If you discover that the person is unwilling to bite the hook, it shows that you haven’t gotten them to be attached.


Keep Them in Anticipation


Don’t grant your target the satisfaction of having figured you out. Make sure that you are a mystery. Put them in a state of suspense to unsure what your next move might be, which may increase their emotional attachment. Do not go for a long time without making contact, dropping a surprise, and making them even more intrigued. 

You want to make sure they can't see what is coming up. You always want to be one-stepped ahead. With every surprise you drop, the change, of course, is going to be a thrill for them.


Ignite Their Passion with Words


Words are the best weapon of a romantic. They can drill into the toughest of hearts and reduce the person into a hopeless romantic. Do not tire of using seductive language, comforting their insecurities, flattering them, giving them promises, enveloping them with sweet words.


Applying Dark Psychology in Your Daily Life


People use psychology in their daily lives, so why not use Dark Psychology and the tactics to guard yourself in everyday life. There are quite a few personality traits that will be very harmful if you get trapped in them.


Sadists fall into this category. For example, this personality type enjoys inflicting suffering on others, especially those that are innocent. They will even do that at the risk of costing them something. Those diagnosed as sadists feel that cruelty is a type of pleasure that is exciting and may even be sexually stimulating.


We do need to face the very fact that we manipulate people and deceive people all the time. When it involves deception, people deceive others on a day to day, but they are also deceiving themselves. People often lie to gain something or to avoid something. They might not want to be punished for action, or they might want to succeed in a goal, and they self-deceive to get there.


Here are some samples of how people can deceive themselves:


Having a tough time studying - this is often a common occurrence. When people try to learn, they find many things that will distract them, especially cell phones and social media apps. They are going to find almost anything to distract them from the task at hand. These types of people seem to have a phobia of not studying long or tolerably, and they are afraid that they are going home with a bad grade, and it will show how unintelligent they are. So, they take the art of self-deception and come up with the thought to help prevent them from studying. This excuse will weigh better in their mind if they do end up getting a bad grade on their test. The person’s subconscious tells them that it is better for them to get bad rates for lack of studying than to study and to fail and, therefore, having to blame their intelligence. They couldn’t accept that.


Here are other ways in which we regularly deceive ourselves:


Procrastinating – People often waste time when they do not want to study or do something important. However, the biggest reason for procrastinating might be the phobia of failing, and procrastinating was just an excuse. Self-confidence is often a problem also.


Drinking, doing drugs, and carrying out bad habits -People often fall into bad habits, drink, or drug to have something to blame if they fail again. This type of person will try to convince themselves that they might be very successful if they stop doing drugs when they deceive themselves and stand in their way.


People often hold back because life is unfair. They tell themselves that we all live in an enormous lie that most people believe in, but not them. It is easier to blame it on life being unfair then hold ourselves accountable for not reaching our goals.


If you realize that you are deceiving yourself, here may be a few 

things that you can do to change that.


Remember that you are smart and the indisputable fact that you have been able to deceive yourself reaffirms it. If you weren't smart, there would be no way you would have been able to come up with a number of those ideas.


It is essential to find out ways to face your fears. If you are running from a particular trauma or not eager to take a test, you have to remind yourself that you are stronger than you can beat it.


Lastly, once you face your fears, your self-confidence and courage will grow.


Manipulation In Our Daily Lives


Manipulation is an underhanded tactic that we are exposed to on a day to day. Manipulators want nothing but to get their needs met, but they are going to use shady methods to do so.


Those who grew up being manipulated, or being around manipulation, find it hard to work out what is happening because if you are experiencing it again, it would feel familiar. Maybe you were manipulated in a previous relationship, or the current relationship you are in reminds you of your childhood.


This fact is important because manipulation tactics break apart communication and break a person’s trust. People will often find ways to control things and play games instead of speaking honestly about what is happening. However, others value communication only to manage things to reveal the other person's weaknesses to be in control. These type of people do that often in conversation. They have no concern with listening to others talk about anything about themselves, and they are not there to help those people get through whatever it is that they are going through. It is all about dominance 

in this case, and that is it. Here are some of the tactics which will be used on an everyday basis. Some of the standard techniques that we will experience are:


_
      


Lying

 – White lies, untruths, partial or half-truths, exaggerations, and stretching the truth. Love Flooding – Through endless compliments, affection, or what is referred to as buttering someone up.


_
      


Love Denial

 – telling someone that they do not love you and withhold your love or affection from them until you get what you want.


_
       


Withdrawal

 – through avoiding the person altogether or giving them the silent treatment.


_
      


Choice Restriction

 – Giving people options that distract them from the one you don’t want them to make.


_
      


Reverse Psychology

 – Trying to get an individual to do the exact opposite of what you want them to do in an attempt to motivate them to do the direct opposite, which is what you wanted them to do in the first place.


_
      


Semantic Manipulation

 – Using common words with an individual and later telling them that you have a different view of the conversation that you just had.


_
      


Being Condescendingly Sarcastic or Having a Patronizing Tone

 – To be fair, we are all guilty of doing this once in a while. But those that are manipulating us in conversation do this consistently. They mocked you; their tone indicates that you are a child, and they belittle you with their words.


_
      


Speaking in Universal Statement or Generalizations

 – The manipulator will take the statement and make it untrue by grossly making it bigger. Generalizations are afforded to those who are a part of a 

group of things. Universal information is more personal.


Recognizing and Avoiding Brainwashing


The word “brainwashing" was used inside the 1950s book by American writer Edward Searcher, 
T

 announcing American troops' treatment at Chinese imprisonment camps during the Korean War.


Brainwashing methodologies are filed as far away as the Egyptian Book of the Dead and used by savage life partners and life partners, self-proclaimed psychics, faction pioneers, mystery social orders, and progressives dictators to bring the others beneath their thumbs and control them eagerly. These methods don't need uncommon weapons or intriguing capacities. Still, they do request an understanding of the human intellect moreover need to abuse it. By understanding these strategies, you will find out how to protect yourself and others from them.


Recognizing Brainwashing Tactics






Know that those plans to brainwash others are slanted to prey upon the frail and defenseless. Possibly nobody can be a target for mind control, but certain men and ladies are more helpless to shape it at specific times. A capable controller knows what to look out for and knows those handling a challenging period in their life or a shift that can or might not be of their making. Potential candidates incorporate:






_
       

People who have lost their jobs and fear for his or her future


_
       

Newly divorced people, mainly when the divorce has been a bitter one


_
       

Those people who have a disorder, especially one that 

they do not understand


_
      

 Individuals who have lost a loved one, especially if they had been very close to this person, had a couple of different buddies.


All these are uncommon favorites of devout religious pioneers. Individuals who are respected as socially ungainly by their Standard peers tend to be antisocial people but search for like-minded individuals who can be few and distant. One specific savage approach would be finding adequate data around the man and their conviction framework to clarify the catastrophe the person has experienced in a design steady with that conviction ready. Afterward, this might be extended to explain history by and large amid that conviction framework, whereas tactfully modifying it to the brainwasher's interpretation.






Be aware of Individuals who plan to isolate a person. Know from outside influences. As people experiencing your catastrophe or other significant life modification tend to feel lonely, even more, skillful brainwasher works to amplify those feelings of isolation. This isolation could take multiple forms.






For teenagers in a cult, it will be preventing them from contacting their friends and family.


To get a significant additional within an abusive relationship, this might mean not letting the victim out of their gardener's sight or allowing contact with relations and friends.


It might entail isolating offenders for prisoners in a prison camp while exposing them to a subtle or overt type of torture.






Look for attacks on the victim's self-esteem. Brainwashing only works when the brainwasher is in a great position with 

the victim. This way means that the victim has to be broken so the brainwasher can reconstruct the victim in their image. This fact is often sometimes accomplished through emotional, psychological, or, ultimately, physical means long enough to physically and mentally wear the victim.






Emotional tortures might start with lying to the sufferer, after which progress to embarrassing or intimidating the victim. This type of torture could also be accomplished with words or gestures, starting from a manifestation of disapproval to invading the victim's personal space.






Look out if you are trying to make being “part of their Group" more desirable than the outside world. Along with wearing down the victim's immunity, it is essential to deliver a seemingly more appealing option from what the victim has known before contacting the brainwasher. This way can be done via many various approaches:






Permit contact with other individuals who have, at some point, been brainwashed. This way makes a kind of peer weight, which energizes the modern casualty to be delighted in and acknowledged by the most recent group. This manner might be braced through touch, rap sessions, or group sex, or from stricter implies like uniform dress code, controlled diet, at the side unbending elective rules. Repeat this message through ways that run from singing or ticking accurately the same phrases repeatedly, as a rule emphasizing particular basic expressions or words. It mimicks the back part of the human heartbeat throughout the Notion leader's speech cadence or musical accompaniment. This fact can be enhanced with light that is perhaps not too dim or overly unpleasant and room temperature to spice up comfort.


Never letting the victim have time to think. This fact might mean not allowing the victim to have some time alone, or it could mean bombarding the victim using repeated lectures on topics beyond understanding while penalizing questions.


Presenting an “us vs. them" mindset in which the thought leader is acceptable, and the outside world is wrong. The aim is to achieve blind obedience, where the victim will dedicate their life and money to the brainwasher and their specified goals.






Recognize that brainwashers frequently offer benefits if the victim has “turned." Once the victim is broken and complacent, they will subsequently be retrained. This way may take anywhere from a few weeks to many decades, based on the brainwashing circumstances.






An extraordinary frame of this complacency is famously called the Stockholm syndrome, where two bank burglars in Sweden in 1973 held four prisoners for 131 hrs. After the prisoners were saved, they found themselves identifying with their captors, to the point this one of the women need to be locked in with her captor, and the other set up lawful defense finance for the offenders. Patty Hearst, seized by the Symbioses Freedom Armed force in 1974, is often referred to as a Stockholm disorder casualty.


Six comprehend new ways of accepting in the victim's brain. A distance of the retraining is completed through a couple of the same conditioning strategies of compensation and discipline. This way was used to break the casualty down in the exceptionally, to start with the area. Positive encounters happen to be used to the advantage of the casualty for considering what the brainwasher wants, whereas negative encounters are used to rebuff the ultimate remnants of insubordination.






Rinse and repeat. Even though Brainwashing can be authoritative and comprehensive, most brainwashers think it is necessary to check their hands' depths over their subjects. Control might be tested in several ways, based on the brainwasher's goals, with all the outcomes ascertaining just how much reinforcement the victim needs to continue being brainwashed.






Extorting cash is a method to test control, as well as enrich the brainwasher's pockets. Alleged psychic Rose Marks used her power on author Jude Deveraux to bilk Deveraux out of $17 million in cash and property, thereby ruining the writer's livelihood...


Commit criminal functions, either together or to get the Brainwasher, is another. Patty Hearst accompanying the SLA on a couple of their robberies, is a good illustration of this.


Pinpointing the Brain-washed


1. Look for a mix of fanaticism and dependence. Brainwashing sufferers can appear dedicated to the group and also its leader to the point of obsession. At the same time, they seem to struggle to deal with issues with no aid of the group or its leader.


2. Look for a “yes person." Brainwashing sufferers will concur unquestioningly with all their group or leader orders, with no respect for this issue of succeeding in lockstep or the results of doing this. They might also withdraw from those that don't share the same interest with the brainwasher.


3. Try to find signs of withdrawal in your life. Brain-washing Victims are usually listless, withdrawn, and barren of whatever personality marked them before they were brainwashed. This fact is often particularly noticeable in both cult victims and spouses in a violent 

relationship.


Some Sufferers could waive their anger, causing Melancholy and a slew of physiological disorders, possibly even suicide. The others might vent their rage on anyone they feel is the root of their problems, frequently during the physical or verbal confrontation.


Rinsing Out the Brainwashing






Make the subject aware that he or she has been brainwashed. This understanding is often combined with jealousy and distress since the issue begins to wonder about matters without having had time to question issues. Gradually, the subject should be aware of just how they had been exploited.






Draw the subject to notions that contradict the Brainwashing. Contact with multiple alternatives, regardless of the niche using way too many options simultaneously, will offer the issue with a fresh, broader perspective to battle the beliefs planted by the brainwasher.






A number of these contrasting ideas can, on their own, develop with their particular type of exploitation. It is also beneficial to seek out unbiased kind of thoughts in these scenarios as you most likely can.


A more powerful type of this vulnerability would be to induce the difficulty of relieving the brain-washing experience by having him or her act it out and providing the subject with options to counteract the brainwashing. Such therapy demands a therapist proficient in psychodrama methods.






Invite the subject to make their conclusions depending on the most recent details. In the beginning, the issue might 

become concerned about making decisions for herself or himself or feel humiliated by making the “wrong" decision today or in the past. With exercise, this stress will probably vanish.
